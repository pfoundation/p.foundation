The first was for the initial announcement, the second for the milestone of sending 1 billion notifications, and now this one. Neither of the earlier drafts made it to the website for one reason or another, so I hope this version covers everything and more._\\n\\nBefore founding P Foundation, I was an early cloud adopter, going back to Google App Engine in 2008-9, and I continued to use the cloud for most projects. But when I started P Foundation in 2021, we made a deliberate, day-one decision to build and operate our own infrastructure end-to-end: from the network layer to the hardware, and eventually run our own data centers.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Control, Privacy, and Scale\\n\\nFrom the outset we kept our use of public cloud minimal and intentional. As a nonprofit, we couldn\u2019t justify locking ourselves into high recurring costs or vendor dependencies for core workloads. We chose to own and run what matters, and avoid deep reliance on the public cloud. When DHH and 37signals publicly detailed their own decision to step back from the cloud in October 2022 (see [\u201cWhy we\u2019re leaving the cloud\u201d](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0)), it simply validated a path we were already on.\\n\\nBy owning our infrastructure, we have real cost control. We know exactly what we spend on hardware, power, and bandwidth, no surprise line items, no \u201cforensic accounting\u201d to decode a monthly bill. One\u2011time investments in servers and networking gear translate into predictable Opex, and the savings go straight back into the mission. In short: owning keeps us in charge of our budget.\\n\\n### Data Sovereignty\\n\\nCost wasn\u2019t the only driver. Data sovereignty and operational independence were, and are, central. We support independent media worldwide and often handle sensitive information. Parking that data in hyperscale clouds can subject it to external jurisdictions and policies outside our control. Running on hardware we choose, in locations we choose, gives us clarity over where assets live and who can access them.\\n\\nThis approach aligns with a broader reassessment of where critical data resides. Regulations and privacy norms are pushing more organizations to keep key systems on infrastructure they control. Our answer is \u201csovereign infrastructure\u201d: our Points of Presence (PoPs) and core systems run on hardware we physically own and administer. Today we operate three principal PoPs that house core databases, application servers, and media repositories. That gives us precise geolocation awareness, access control, and a security posture that\u2019s hard to match in a generic public\u2011cloud setup.\\n\\n### Better Performance for Less\\n\\nAn added benefit of running our own infrastructure is the performance improvement. We anticipated cost and control advantages, but our applications also became faster and more responsive after migrating to our own hardware. This confirmed that on-prem can be not only economically prudent but also technically superior for stable, heavy workloads.\\n\\nWe optimized our infrastructure for the specific needs of our Media Guard platform and other services. By using bare-metal servers with high-performance CPUs, ample RAM, and fast NVMe storage, we eliminated the overhead and noisy neighbors common in public cloud instances. Applications now have full use of the hardware, and we can fine-tune the environment in ways not possible in a generic cloud setup. The result is lower latency in database queries, faster page loads, and higher capacity for concurrent users. Our users, journalists, researchers, and citizens accessing our partners\u2019 media sites, enjoy a snappier, more reliable experience.\\n\\nReliability has also improved. By distributing infrastructure across multiple PoPs, we have built redundancy and fault tolerance into our network. If one pop encounters an issue, others can take over, something harder to achieve in a single cloud region. Additionally, direct peering with local ISPs and internet exchanges allows us to route around problems and avoid congestion.\\n\\n### Strategic Cloud Use\\n\\nBuilding on the performance and reliability gains from our own infrastructure, we also examined which elements could still benefit from selective cloud use.\\n\\nWhile we have intentionally avoided relying on the cloud for most workloads, we recognized there were areas where it made sense to use it. For certain functions, particularly long-term storage and archival, the cloud\u2019s scale and cost-efficiency are hard to beat. Building our own global cold storage system would have been impractical given the large volume of archives and backups we manage, most of which are rarely accessed. Instead of investing in massive storage arrays, we use cost-effective cloud services such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for bulk storage and [AWS Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) for deep archives.\\n\\nThis approach gives us the best of both worlds. We keep live, mission-critical systems under our control, while leveraging the cloud\u2019s economies of scale for rarely accessed data. S3 provides affordable storage, and Glacier offers ultra-low-cost archival. The cost per terabyte is so low that it outcompetes running our own tape libraries or spinning disks, especially when factoring in maintenance and power.\\n\\nWe encrypt any sensitive data stored in the cloud with our own keys, addressing sovereignty concerns. For now, this mix of ownership and selective renting gives us maximum value: we control high-impact workloads and rent low-cost storage. As our needs grow, we will periodically revisit these decisions.\\n\\n### Cloudflare Love\\n\\nWhile Cloudflare is a third-party provider, its role in our ecosystem complements rather than contradicts our sovereign approach. We regard it as a strategic ally whose services enhance rather than diminish our autonomy, operating as a neutral, globally distributed network layer under our configuration and control.\\n\\nBy leveraging their infrastructure without ceding ownership of our core systems, we extend our reach and resilience while preserving the independence central to our philosophy. From their innovative [Project Galileo](https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/), which offers free protection to at-risk organizations, to robust load balancing and DDoS mitigation tools, Cloudflare\u2019s services are deeply integrated into our stack. Their global network ensures fast, secure content delivery worldwide, and their fair, reasonable pricing keeps these advantages within reach for a nonprofit like ours.\\n\\nIn many ways, Cloudflare complements our sovereign infrastructure by adding another layer of resilience and reach.\\n\\nWe also recognize that there are moments when demand exceeds our own capacity. During major events such as presidential elections or sudden breaking news with massive audience spikes, we temporarily rely on external content delivery networks to help handle the load. This approach ensures that users continue to enjoy a seamless experience even when traffic surges unexpectedly. By combining our own infrastructure with these external resources only when necessary, we strike a balance between sovereignty, cost-effectiveness, and readiness for high-impact moments.\\n\\n### Media Guard\\n\\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of our infrastructure is our Media Guard program, which provides technical infrastructure to independent media outlets worldwide. This includes satellite news downlinking, backhaul support, digital streaming, and content distribution. In essence, we serve as the backend backbone that helps keep news sites and streams online, even in challenging environments.\\n\\nMany of our partners previously hosted their content on cloud or shared hosting platforms. As we integrate them into Media Guard, we transition them to our infrastructure, lowering latency, improving performance, and eliminating surprise bandwidth bills. Serving content from local PoPs instead of distant cloud regions improves user experience and reliability.\\n\\nOwning the platform also lets us tailor support and protection. We can apply custom caching rules, DDoS protection, and high-availability setups to match each partner\u2019s needs. In crisis situations, having control over the servers allows rapid response, rerouting traffic, provisioning extra capacity, or shielding at-risk sites. For partners facing cyberattacks or censorship, this can be life-saving.\\n\\nMigrating partners from cloud setups to our PoPs is not simple, but our team provides hands-on support to ensure smooth transitions. This consolidation allows us to onboard more organizations without proportionally increasing costs, which is vital for our nonprofit model.\\n\\n### Reinvesting\\n\\nThe savings from avoiding high cloud costs have allowed us to expand and innovate. We have been able to invest in new regions, such as launching the [OpenIX Beirut](/updates/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut) to localize internet infrastructure in Lebanon. We are also exploring new PoPs in other areas to improve local media connectivity.\\n\\nWe invested in our own GPU cluster, enabling us to run AI workloads in-house instead of paying for expensive cloud GPUs. This has allowed us to develop AI tools for our partner newsrooms, such as automatic video transcription, AI-based content moderation, and intelligent alert systems. These tools require significant compute power, which we can now provide ourselves.\\n\\nOwning our infrastructure has also fostered a culture of optimization and experimentation. Our engineers understand the full stack, which sparks creative solutions. We can adopt new technologies at our own pace, without waiting for cloud vendor support.\\n\\n### Oh, 1 Billion Notifications Monthly\\n\\nBack to where I began. When we started offering ONS to our partners, we knew how critical it was to deliver notifications quickly and reliably. We also wanted a solution we could deploy rapidly, and the cloud offered a quicker path to getting started without heavy upfront infrastructure work. Initially, we used [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) through [StreamNative](https://streamnative.io/), but as with other cloud services, costs grew quickly. Pulsar\u2019s complexity also made it challenging to run in our fully independent, multi-region setup.\\n\\nThat changed when we discovered [NATS](https://nats.io/), which we now run across all our regions. NATS has been transformative: lightweight, incredibly fast, and designed with simplicity and scalability in mind. Its built-in features for clustering, persistence, and streaming allow us to operate a truly distributed messaging system that matches our independent, multi-PoP architecture perfectly. NATS handles millions of messages per second with ease, giving us confidence that critical alerts will always get through.\\n\\nWith NATS, we are delivering **1 billion** mobile notifications every month, a milestone that not only encapsulates the technical and strategic journey described from the outset, but also affirms the transformative impact of building and maintaining our sovereign infrastructure, from urgent evacuation orders and life-saving blood bank requests to traffic updates and breaking news alerts. The Open Notification Service has become a vital lifeline for the communities we serve and for our partners, enabling real-time communication that can improve safety, inform citizens, and even save lives. Whether it\u2019s warning people in conflict zones, helping coordinate emergency responses, or simply keeping the public informed, ONS is proving how infrastructure choices directly impact human well-being."},{"id":"IntroducingOpenIXBeirut","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut","source":"@site/updates/2025-05-13-introducing_edgeIX_beirut.md","title":"Announcing OpenIX Beirut","description":"Launching Lebanon\u2019s first carrier-neutral Internet Exchange Point to localize traffic and dramatically improve internet performance.","date":"2025-05-13T19:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":5.1,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jud Saoud","title":"COO of P Foundation","email":"jud@p.foundation","imageURL":"https://github.com/judsd.png","key":"jud","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing OpenIX Beirut","description":"Launching Lebanon\u2019s first carrier-neutral Internet Exchange Point to localize traffic and dramatically improve internet performance.","slug":"IntroducingOpenIXBeirut","authors":"jud","hide_table_of_contents":false,"date":"2025-05-13T19:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1764208946000,"prevItem":{"title":"Owning the Stack","permalink":"/updates/OwningTheStack"},"nextItem":{"title":"Roadmap to 2027","permalink":"/updates/roadmap_to_2027"}},"content":"We initially envisioned OpenIX as a program that provides grants, training, technical assistance, and equipment to set up micro-efficient IXs\u2014neutral hubs where networks openly peer and enjoy low-cost colocation. The vision was to bring internet content and service providers together locally, enabling data to be exchanged within Lebanon instead of traversing distant overseas hubs.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nHowever, after extensive discussions with various stakeholders and recognizing the urgency and long-term value, we decided to take a more proactive approach. We are now directly initiating, operating, and maintaining OpenIX Beirut, committing fully to this endeavor for the next 10 years.\\n\\nOur goal is for OpenIX Beirut to become Lebanon\u2019s first truly carrier-neutral Internet Exchange, significantly enhancing the nation\u2019s internet infrastructure.\\n\\n## Localizing Lebanon\u2019s Internet Traffic\\n\\nLebanon currently lacks any active IX, forcing local internet traffic to traverse international routes unnecessarily. The country\u2019s previous two exchange points, including Beirut-IX launched in 2007, never scaled effectively and are now defunct. Consequently, even when Lebanese users access local content, the data frequently travels thousands of kilometers to Europe and back, typically via Marseille or Paris, just to reach a nearby network. Although major content providers have recently installed local caches, historically most traffic has been routed via Europe due to the national backbone (Ogero) primarily connecting there. Such indirect paths add substantial latency (\\\\~50 milliseconds round-trip), degrade user experience, and inflate transit costs for ISPs.\\n\\nThis challenge extends beyond Lebanon, reflecting a broader regional issue. Internet exchange infrastructure in the Middle East and Africa remains underdeveloped, resulting in excessive overseas routing, higher costs, and slower speeds. As of 2021, about 83% of Middle Eastern internet bandwidth was routed through Europe. Many countries rely on European exchange points like Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, and Paris/Marseille, highlighting the stark performance gap compared to regions with established local IXs. Lebanon\'s situation, where even intra-country data loops through Europe, clearly demonstrates the critical need for a local IX.\\n\\n## Open, Neutral, Micro-Efficient IXs\\n\\nOpenIX represents P Foundation\u2019s commitment to addressing this problem by establishing efficient, impactful IXs in underserved areas. Key features of OpenIX Beirut include:\\n\\n- Grants & Equipment: Funding and donated hardware (switches, routers, etc.) to fully equip the exchange.\\n- Training & Technical Assistance: Expert guidance on IX operations, BGP peering arrangements, and exchange management best practices.\\n- Carrier-Neutral Colocation: A neutral, affordable facility for all network operators, ensuring no single ISP or telco dominates.\\n- Open Peering Policy: Freely accessible peering for all participants, promoting maximum interconnection among ISPs, content providers, educational institutions, and others.\\n- Micro-Efficiency: Compact, optimized infrastructure delivering high performance sustainably with minimal footprint and costs.\\n\\nOpenIX Beirut brings the exchange closer to users, eliminating the need for Lebanese traffic to travel through distant hubs. This will dramatically reduce latency (by tens of milliseconds per packet) and significantly lower IP transit costs for local ISPs. Importantly, a neutral IX reduces dependency on any single upstream provider, enhancing the resilience of Lebanon\u2019s internet connectivity.\\n\\n## Lebanon\u2019s Chance to Catch Up\\n\\nInternet Exchange Points have long been integral to internet growth. Many global IXs began as community or academic projects, with the first established in 1988 at a university campus. These early IXs demonstrated the benefits of local interconnection: faster, cheaper access for everyone. Major tech hubs worldwide\u2014such as Silicon Valley and Amsterdam\u2014now thrive due to robust IXs handling substantial local traffic.\\n\\nHowever, the Middle East and Africa remain largely underserved in terms of IXs. Lebanon\u2019s first attempt in 2007 at the American University of Beirut showed promise but faltered due to limited participation. Today, Lebanon still lacks a fully functional IX, exacerbating its digital divide through heavy dependence on international bandwidth. OpenIX Beirut aims to transform this landscape, placing Lebanon firmly on the map of globally connected internet communities.\\n\\nWe are confident this model works. For example, Kenya and Nigeria increased local traffic exchange from about 30% to 70% within eight years by developing strong IXs. Inspired by these success stories, our ambitious goal is to achieve over 70% local traffic exchange in Lebanon by Summer 2025. This means everything\u2014from videos to financial transactions and academic resources\u2014will reach users locally without leaving the country.\\n\\n_With OpenIX Beirut, local ISPs and content providers will directly exchange traffic within Lebanon, significantly boosting speed, reliability, and efficiency._\\n\\n## Timeline and Expectations\\n\\nAfter extensive planning, OpenIX Beirut is officially underway. Key milestones include:\\n\\n- **May 2025**: Establishing governance and technical setup through collaboration with local stakeholders.\\n- **June 2025**: Hardware delivery and establishment of local fiber connectivity.\\n- **July 2025**: Initial participation from 9 of Lebanon\'s 14 major ISPs (representing 40% of the market) and multiple content providers.\\n- **Summer 2025**: Expanding participation to 13 of the 14 major ISPs.\\n- **Beyond 2025**: Ongoing expansion, capacity upgrades, and gradual transition to community-led governance.\\n\\nFor Lebanese internet users, these developments mean tangible improvements: faster website loading, smoother streaming, and lower latency in gaming. Local hosting will become viable, freeing up costly international bandwidth for essential overseas traffic.\\n\\n## Community Impact\\n\\nThe launch of OpenIX Beirut marks more than just a technical improvement\u2014it is a community milestone. It unites telecom operators, private ISPs, universities, and content companies in enhancing Lebanon\u2019s digital ecosystem. Localized traffic means faster, more affordable, and resilient internet, benefitting everything from business services to education tools. Critically, local peering ensures continued domestic connectivity even if international routes face disruptions.\\n\\nOpenIX Beirut also serves as a pilot for broader regional expansion. Our mission at P Foundation is to foster a more equitable, distributed internet, enabling every community to fully engage in the global digital economy.\\n\\nWe warmly invite all Lebanese ISPs, telecom carriers, content providers, and community networks to join OpenIX Beirut. The benefits of local peering\u2014lower latency, reduced costs, enhanced user experiences\u2014are immediate and substantial. Regional and global partners interested in supporting or participating are also encouraged to connect.\\n\\nTo learn more or to participate, contact us at [openix.beirut@p.foundation](mailto:openix.beirut@p.foundation).\\n\\n_Note on naming: We briefly referred to this initiative as EdgeIX, but upon learning of EdgeIX Australia, we chose OpenIX to avoid potential naming conflicts and ensure clarity for our global audience._"},{"id":"roadmap_to_2027","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/roadmap_to_2027","source":"@site/updates/2024-03-31-roadmap_to_2027.md","title":"Roadmap to 2027","description":"AThe past year has been one of immense growth and learning for our team and the communities we serve.

In 2021, as I approached my 30th birthday, the introspection was different. I found myself thinking not just about my past but also about my legacy. It wasn\'t just another birthday\u2014it was a turning point.\\n\\nI grew up in a Lebanese Christian household that resisted the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. We criticized the United States role in the situation, yet we understood that only the US had the power to change it. My father was a remarkable figure in my life, always instilling in me that there are no limits to what we can achieve, that we control our own destiny, and that our choices define us. Later, my brother played an even bigger role in shaping my worldview. He introduced me to different cultures, sects and unwittingly led me to the world of media. I had the unique opportunity to grow up in newsrooms\u2014first at a radio station, then at a television network. This exposure, at such an early age, laid the foundation for everything I would do later.\\n\\nIn my younger years, I started out as a developer. I moved into the corporate world, but it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that it wasn\u2019t where I belonged. I left to pursue commercial media independently, only to find myself eventually shifting toward communications. None of these transitions were planned; they happened because I saw a goal worth pursuing in each new phase.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lebanon was enduring its third year of a deepening financial crisis. Poverty was on the rise, infrastructure was crumbling, and basic services were failing. Some areas were dealing with daily internet blackouts, impacting not only households but essential services like medication distribution. Internet access had become a political bargaining chip, with politicians using it as leverage against the public.\\n\\nAs my 30th birthday approached, I knew I could no longer afford to move forward without a clear plan. I decided that I was done doing things that didn\u2019t resonate with me. The best legacy, I believed, was one that left a positive impact on the community.\\nI am a firm believer that open internet access is as vital as education for the future of any nation. Free journalism is another pillar I stand by. Both of these beliefs converged on that introspective day, and before I knew it, I was filling out paperwork to register a foundation in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nI\u2019ve always preferred working behind the scenes, and it was no different for the foundation. I didn\'t even bother to create a Twitter account for it. I focused on building a network that would serve as the backbone for our future endeavors. At the same time, I reached out to friends in media organizations, trying to understand their challenges and exploring ways to help. Parallel to this, we were tackling smaller but significant issues, such as minor internet outages in Lebanon. By working with different organizations, we aimed to keep people connected, even if that meant nudging entities to simply do their jobs or by integrating with their teams to directly address the challenges they faced.\\n\\nThe vision for the foundation took shape gradually. We began developing programs that addressed core challenges, while also stepping in with initiatives when crises struck. One such example was @LebanonAlerts, a small but impactful initiative which helped alleviate local fear and anxiety following the deadly 2023 earthquake in Turkey.\\n\\nOn October 7th, we woke up to news of a massacre in south Israel, only for certain groups in Lebanon to use the situation as a pretext to ignite tensions with Israel. By October 18th, we had prepared our media continuity plan, scaling up resources and preparing for a potential escalation between Israel and Hezbollah. Ensuring Lebanon\u2019s continued access to the internet was a priority for us, and as we observed the Lebanese government\'s inadequate response, we put together a connectivity response plan and began communicating with relevant parties. Unfortunately, political complications led to our plan being sidelined - Hezbollah\u2019s opposition being a major reason. Setbacks are an inevitable part of any meaningful journey, but we remain committed to ensuring that Lebanon stays connected.\\n\\nCreating a traditional roadmap in such an unpredictable environment, especially in the Middle East where we operate, would be impractical. Instead, we need a flexible framework\u2014one that could adapt to the ever-changing political and social landscape, allowing us to respond effectively to new challenges as they arise.With all these considerations, here are the key priorities and goals I envision for the next three years:\\n\\n### Expand our Partnerships\\n\\nWe aim to increase the number of beneficiaries of our programs by adding more organizations to our MediaGuard initiative. Transitioning infrastructure is not an easy task, especially for organizations with small digital teams\u2014often consisting of just one system administrator, if not outsourced. To facilitate this transition, we plan to offer more personalized, one-on-one support and a dedicated point of contact to improve efficiency and ensure a smoother migration process.\\n\\n### Strengthen Citizen-Focused Programs and Initiatives\\n\\nBy collaborating closely with various stakeholders, we see opportunities to offer more tools, utilities, and integrated support, particularly to existing organizations that directly serve citizens. Our goal is to deepen our partnerships with organizations that have significant grassroots experience and direct impact on citizens\' lives. By doing so, we can better address community needs and enhance the support provided to individuals on the ground.\\n\\n### Forward Deployed Software Engineer Model\\n\\nI am a strong advocate of the Forward Deployed Software Engineer (FDSE) role and model, originally popularized by Palantir. This approach blends software engineering expertise with direct client engagement, allowing for rapid problem-solving and effective integration. By adopting this model, we can address issues more quickly and provide end-to-end solutions for the challenges faced by our partners.\\n\\nUntil now, I have personally integrated with every new partner\u2014working alongside them throughout various stages, joining internal scrum calls, and collaborating closely with their developers, system administrators, management, and other teams to create solutions that meet everyone\'s needs.\\n\\nThe talent pool for Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSE) is currently very limited, if not non-existent, in the Middle East. I see a significant opportunity to transform this gap into a structured program or initiative. Such a program would foster creativity, technical problem-solving, and a collaborative mindset, equipping software engineers with the skills to adapt to rapid project changes and make independent decisions effectively.\\n\\n### Expanding Our Programs\\n\\nThrough my close integration with various partners, I have identified several key services and integrations that they continually struggle with. These range from basic functionalities, such as managing and scaling push notification services, to more complex, deeply-rooted challenges within their newsrooms.\\n\\nBy leveraging advancements in machine learning\u2014often referred to as \\"AI\\"\u2014we have managed to accelerate our development processes without expanding our team excessively. This approach allows us to release features more rapidly and introduce new functionalities at a greater pace.\\nBuilding on these advancements, we aim to expand our programs with additional offerings, enhancing the support we provide to our partners and addressing their most pressing needs.\\n\\nOne might think that three years is plenty of time to achieve these goals\u2014and it certainly seems that way. However, given the ever-changing dynamics of the Middle East, this is ultimately a long-term vision for what we hope to accomplish.\\n\\nStay safe,\\\\\\nJud"},{"id":"lebanon_crisis_response_plan","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/lebanon_crisis_response_plan","source":"@site/updates/2023-10-31-crisis_response_plan.md","title":"Lebanon Crisis Response Plan","description":"P Foundation crisis response plan in case of military conflict in Lebanon.","date":"2023-10-31T08:20:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.75,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jud Saoud","title":"COO of P Foundation","email":"jud@p.foundation","imageURL":"https://github.com/judsd.png","key":"jud","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Lebanon Crisis Response Plan","description":"P Foundation crisis response plan in case of military conflict in Lebanon.","slug":"lebanon_crisis_response_plan","authors":"jud","hide_table_of_contents":false,"date":"2023-10-31T08:20:00.000Z","last_update":{"date":"2023-11-29T19:00:00.000Z"}},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1701284400000,"prevItem":{"title":"Roadmap to 2027","permalink":"/updates/roadmap_to_2027"},"nextItem":{"title":"MediaGuard Continuity Plan for Lebanon Conflict","permalink":"/updates/mediaguard_continuity_plan"}},"content":"With the escalating potential for military conflict in Lebanon, the P Foundation has activated its crisis response plan.

This document outlines the key elements of the grant proposal.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Critical Infrastructure Connectivity (ResilientNet)\\n\\nResilientNet aims to maintain internet connectivity for critical establishments imperative for public welfare.\\n\\nCentral to this program is a meticulous, needs-based assessment methodology, tailored to discern the distinct connectivity requisites of each targeted critical establishment.\\n\\nAlthough we have streamlined the assessment process typically applied, our deployment priority is directed towards first responders, medical facilities, and select public establishments.\\n\\n| Category           | Entity             | Locations | Mobile Locations |\\n| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------- |\\n| First Responders   | Red Cross          | 25        | 1                |\\n| First Responders   | Civil Defense      | 3         | 0                |\\n| First Responders   | ISF                | 3         | 0                |\\n| Emergency Services | Hospitals          | 29        | 0                |\\n| Emergency Services | Forensic Labs (UL) | 1         | 0                |\\n| Utilities          | EDL                | 1         | 0                |\\n| Utilities          | Ogero              | 2         | 0                |\\n| Utilities          | Civil Aviation     | 1         | 0                |\\n| Utilities          | Beirut Port        | 1         | 0                |\\n| Utilities          | Tripoli Port       | 1         | 0                |\\n| Utilities          | Mic 1              | 2         | 0                |\\n| Utilities          | Mic 2              | 2         | 0                |\\n| Lebanon Government | Ministries         | 17        | 0                |\\n| Lebanon Government | Parliament         | 1         | 0                |\\n| Lebanon Government | Public Media       | 3         | 0                |\\n| Replacement        |                    | 5         | 0                |\\n\\n### Deployment Process\\n\\nEach entity entitled to ResilientNet (through Ministry of Telecommunications) must submit a request using the webform or by email to crisisresponse@p.foundation, including the following details:\\n\\n- Name of the organization\\n- Number of people benefiting from the service (if applicable)\\n- Internet access requirement (e.g. speed, wifi, lan, bgp, dedicated ip, ...)\\n- Network Reuqirement\\n- Location of facility, including coordinates or a Google Maps link (The service will be limited mentioned location.)\\n- Point of Contact\\n- Technical Point of Contact\\n- Upon receiving your request, we will review all the provided information and forward it to the Ministry of Telecom for approval.\\n\\nOnce approved, the required devices will be allocated to you for collection, and you will be added to relevant messaging groups to assist you with the setup.\\n\\nWhile the hardware is in your possession, it is your responsibility to maintain and safeguard it, ensuring its return in the same condition it was received.\\n\\n## Community Connectivity (Citizen Mesh)\\n\\nThe P Foundation deeply acknowledges the transformative essence of connectivity. Internet access during conflicts acts as a channel for information dissemination, public engagement, and global cognizance, thus underscoring the resilience of internet infrastructure.\\n\\nInternet access during conflicts serve as a conduit for information warfare, public engagement, and global awareness. The digital landscape facilitates real-time updates and citizen-driven narratives, contributing to a broader understanding and sometimes humanitarian response to the unfolding crisis. Moreover, the resilience of internet infrastructure underlines its significance in maintaining communication channels, while also spotlighting issues surrounding digital rights, cybersecurity, and narrative control in such geopolitical confrontations.\\n\\nOur crisis response extends our Citizen Mesh program, incorporating multiple open access services.\\n\\n### Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs)\\n\\n_Pending MOU with LRC _\\n\\nIn collaboration with local partners, and P Foundation volunteers, we aim to establish over 50 Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs) across secure Lebanese territories in the event of a conflict, prioritizing areas with a high influx of displaced individuals and erratic internet access.\\n\\nEach zone is equipped with multiple WiFi access points, facilitating easy internet access for the public.\\n\\nThese zones are solar-powered and designed to provide internet connectivity for at least 18 hours a day. During daylight hours, each zone is equipped with power cords allowing the public to charge their devices.\\n\\nIf mandated by Lebanese Authorities, individuals accessing the internet via the EICZs may be required to register and verify their identity before connecting.\\n\\nThe list of active EICZs will be available on our website, as well as on social channels.\\n\\n#### Additional Information\\n\\nTo cater to the maximum number of users, we employ real-time internet quality monitoring. During periods of peak usage, access to video and streaming services may be restricted.\\n\\nFurthermore, since the service is provided in public spaces, we utilize Cloudflare\'s 1.1.1.1 service to safeguard families by blocking access to malware and adult content.\\n\\n### Mobile Internet Connectivity Zones\\n\\nSimilar to EICZs, we have prepared 2 Mobile EICZs (MICZs) ready for deployment to locations that necessitate vital internet access following certain events.\\n\\nThe MICZs utilize specialized mobile hardware that facilitates immediate internet deployment, providing access via both WiFi and ethernet.\\n\\nWe anticipate that individuals will utilize MICZs to connect with family and friends, reassuring them of their safety. Additionally, media organizations can leverage MICZs as a backup for their live reporting.\\n\\n### Post Conflict Assignment\\n\\nFollowing the conclusion of the conflict, and as displaced individuals begin to return to their hometowns, the EICZs can be dynamically relocated to provide connectivity while Ogero continues to restore the damaged infrastructure.\\n\\n## Change Log\\n\\n**11/29/23 17:00**\\n\\n- Added note related to the cabinet session.\\n\\n**11/05/23 17:00**\\n\\n- Added details to deployment process\\n\\n**10/31/23 22:05**\\n\\n- Removed \\"Needs based assestment\\" from ResilientNet segment.\\n- Updated allocations table."},{"id":"mediaguard_continuity_plan","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/mediaguard_continuity_plan","source":"@site/updates/2023-10-18-mediaguard-lebanonconflcit23.md","title":"MediaGuard Continuity Plan for Lebanon Conflict","description":"P Foundation is redoubling its efforts through MediaGuard program, which has been steadfastly supporting journalists and media organizations for the past 18 months\u2014all at no cost.","date":"2023-10-18T13:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.93,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jud Saoud","title":"COO of P Foundation","email":"jud@p.foundation","imageURL":"https://github.com/judsd.png","key":"jud","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"MediaGuard Continuity Plan for Lebanon Conflict","description":"P Foundation is redoubling its efforts through MediaGuard program, which has been steadfastly supporting journalists and media organizations for the past 18 months\u2014all at no cost.","slug":"mediaguard_continuity_plan","authors":"jud","hide_table_of_contents":false,"date":"2023-10-18T13:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1764208946000,"prevItem":{"title":"Lebanon Crisis Response Plan","permalink":"/updates/lebanon_crisis_response_plan"}},"content":"Given the recent escalaction in Gaza, we perceive an escalating risk of military conflict between Israel and Lebanon.\\n\\nWe\'re concerned that many media outlets, despite having business continuity plans, may be underestimating the scale of a potential conflict.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn response, we are redoubling our efforts through our [MediaGuard](/programs) program, which has been steadfastly supporting journalists and media organizations for the past 18 months\u2014all at no cost.\\n\\nThe [MediaGuard](/programs) program exemplifies our commitment to fortifying media organizations worldwide by offering a range of customized, free-of-charge services such as backhaul support, downlinking, digital streaming, and content distribution.\\n\\nCentral to MediaGuard\'s mission is aiding media organizations in achieving and maintaining operational stability. Consequently, P Foundation is extending various specialized services through MediaGuard in the event of conflict, also free of charge.\\n\\n## For TV Broadcasters\\n\\n### Backbone and Playout Support\\n\\nAlthough an internet blackout may not occur immediately, we anticipate that it could become a reality if the conflict lasts longer than 30 days.\\n\\nWhile most tv broadcaster in Lebanon use IP for their backhaul, we believe they all also maintain a satellite backup. We urge all broadcasters to ensure that their satellite backup is operational.\\n\\nIn addition to the satellite backup, we have expanded our computing capacities in both London and New York which would allow us to allocate enough resources for all broadcasters to maintain a backup playout in case of emergency. We recommend that you upload backup content from now instead of waiting for last minute. Please communicate your requirements to your contact point, and we will allocate the necessary resources.\\n\\nOur infrastructure includes Zixi encoders in both locations and we maintains an open channel with Arabsat NOC, enabling broadcasters to switch to a backup within minutes of any outage.\\n\\n### Live Streaming\\n\\nLive broadcasts are crucial news sources during conflicts.\\n\\nWe strongly recommend that media organizations shift their digital streaming to utilize offshore facilities. If you don\'t have one ready, our Spain-based facilities can downlink most beams from Arabsat and Nilesat, and we are able to allocate resources for you to stream from there. Please reach out to your contact point at PF to arrange.\\n\\nWe are also enabling our MediaGuard dashboard for all broadcasters to downlink their feeds and restream them to their content distribution partners and social platforms.\\n\\nWith an anticipated surge in online viewership, we advise broadcasters to expand their live streaming to additional platforms like YouTube, Rumble, and X.\\n\\nFor those experiencing growing viewership on their proprietary platforms and unable to switch to others, we\'ve partnere with multiple CDNs and we are able to increase the free content distribution limit from 100TB a month to 1PB.\\n\\n## For Broadcasters, Print and Online Media\\n\\n### Increased attacks\\n\\nIt is typical for any military conflict to extend to the cyberspace, and this was [evident](https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-israel-and-palestine-following-the-october-2023-attacks/) in Gaza and Israel past few days. We expect the same to happen in Lebanon.\\n\\nAlong with traditional DDOS attack, we expect an increase in phishing attacks on journalists and media organizations. We urge all media organizations to be extra vigilant and send a reminder to all staff to be extra cautious when opening emails and clicking on links, specially their digital teams.\\n\\nWhile most organisations already use Cloudflare, we believe some have had security gaps that left their origins exposed and vulnerable to attacks. If you are not sure about your security setup, please reach out to your contact point at PF and we will help you assess your setup and make the necessary changes.\\n\\nWe recommend that you increase your replication resources or maintain hourly backups. If your provider support ransom protection, that we definitely recommend that you enable it.\\n\\nIn addition, we have increased our capacity in DC, and we are able to accomodate most media platforms. If you think that you are likely to be targeted and you prefer to move your website to our isolated infrastructure, please reach out to your contact points at PF and we will help you with the migration.\\n\\n### Shared Working Space\\n\\nWe recognize that not all media organizations have their own facilities or contingency plans. To address this, we\'ve set up a 300-square-meter shared working space in a designated \\"safe area.\\"\\n\\nDesigned to accommodate 35-40 people at a time, the space has sufficient diesel reserves to offer continuous power for up to 45 days. It also features multiple backhauls to ensure a stable internet connection.\\n\\nThough the facility is open to all journalists, we request that you contact us via Discord or email (mediaguard@p.foundation) and include copies of IDs or Passports for those planning to use the facility."}]}}')}}]);
