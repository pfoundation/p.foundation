# P Foundation

**Empowering nations with open internet and free journalism.**

P Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation registered in Washington, DC, dedicated to bridging the digital divide and promoting open access to information worldwide. Established in 2021, we serve the global community with a focused commitment to the Middle East and Lebanon, where the need for open internet and free journalism is crucial.

## Our Mission

At the core of our foundation lies the ethos that an open internet and free journalism form the backbone of every progressive nation, binding societies with threads of transparency, accountability, and uninhibited expression. We envision a world where every individual, irrespective of their location or background, has unhindered access to the vast reservoirs of knowledge and information the internet has to offer.

## Our Values

Our work is guided by four core principles:

- **Patriotism**: We fuel our drive to serve the nations we operate in, ensuring that the benefits of our efforts are felt at every grassroots level.
- **Passion**: Our passion for an open internet propels us forward, driving us to challenge the status quo and break down barriers.
- **Persistence**: This helps us overcome challenges, ensuring that we remain committed to our goals no matter the hurdles.
- **Partnership**: Our belief in global partnerships stems from understanding that collaborative efforts amplify impact. By forging alliances with like-minded entities, we strive to achieve collective success that benefits all.

## Background & Rationale

The P Foundation emerged from a profound belief in the power of media and the transformative capabilities of technology. Founded during a period of significant challenges in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon where internet access had become a political bargaining chip and infrastructure was crumbling, we recognized the urgent need for sustainable solutions.

Our founder's journey from developer to media professional, combined with exposure to newsrooms and understanding of both technical and communications challenges, laid the foundation for our comprehensive approach to digital empowerment.
