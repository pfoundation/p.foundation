        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[P Foundation built its own sovereign infrastructure to cut costs, boost performance, and protect data, helping independent media and communities.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>I think this might be my fourth draft about ONS (Open Notification Service). The first was for the initial announcement, the second for the milestone of sending 1 billion notifications, and now this one. Neither of the earlier drafts made it to the website for one reason or another, so I hope this version covers everything and more.</em></p>
<p>Before founding P Foundation, I was an early cloud adopter, going back to Google App Engine in 2008-9, and I continued to use the cloud for most projects. But when I started P Foundation in 2021, we made a deliberate, day‑one decision to build and operate our own infrastructure end‑to‑end: from the network layer to the hardware and, ultimately, our own data centers.</p>
<p>From the outset we kept our use of public cloud minimal and intentional. As a nonprofit, we couldn’t justify locking ourselves into high recurring costs or vendor dependencies for core workloads. We chose to own and run what matters, and avoid deep reliance on the public cloud. When DHH and 37signals publicly detailed their own decision to step back from the cloud in October 2022, it simply validated a path we were already on.</p>
<p>By owning our infrastructure, we have real cost control. We know exactly what we spend on hardware, power, and bandwidth, no surprise line items, no “forensic accounting” to decode a monthly bill. One‑time investments in servers and networking gear translate into predictable Opex, and the savings go straight back into the mission. In short: owning keeps us in charge of our budget.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-sovereignty-and-owning-our-destiny">Data Sovereignty and Owning Our Destiny<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/PowerOfOurSovereignPlatform#data-sovereignty-and-owning-our-destiny" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Sovereignty and Owning Our Destiny" title="Direct link to Data Sovereignty and Owning Our Destiny">​</a></h3>
<p>Cost wasn’t the only driver. Data sovereignty and operational independence were, and are, central. We support independent media worldwide and often handle sensitive information. Parking that data in hyperscale clouds can subject it to external jurisdictions and policies outside our control. Running on hardware we choose, in locations we choose, gives us clarity over where assets live and who can access them.</p>
<p>This approach aligns with a broader reassessment of where critical data resides. Regulations and privacy norms are pushing more organizations to keep key systems on infrastructure they control. Our answer is “sovereign infrastructure”: our Points of Presence (PoPs) and core systems run on hardware we physically own and administer. Today we operate three principal PoPs that house core databases, application servers, and media repositories. That gives us precise geolocation awareness, access control, and a security posture that’s hard to match in a generic public‑cloud setup.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="better-performance-for-less">Better Performance for Less<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/PowerOfOurSovereignPlatform#better-performance-for-less" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better Performance for Less" title="Direct link to Better Performance for Less">​</a></h3>
<p>An added benefit of running our own infrastructure is the performance improvement. We anticipated cost and control advantages, but our applications also became faster and more responsive after migrating to our own hardware. This confirmed that on-prem can be not only economically prudent but also technically superior for stable, heavy workloads.</p>
<p>We optimized our infrastructure for the specific needs of our Media Guard platform and other services. By using bare-metal servers with high-performance CPUs, ample RAM, and fast NVMe storage, we eliminated the overhead and noisy neighbors common in public cloud instances. Applications now have full use of the hardware, and we can fine-tune the environment in ways not possible in a generic cloud setup. The result is lower latency in database queries, faster page loads, and higher capacity for concurrent users. Our users, journalists, researchers, and citizens accessing our partners’ media sites, enjoy a snappier, more reliable experience.</p>
<p>Reliability has also improved. By distributing infrastructure across multiple PoPs, we have built redundancy and fault tolerance into our network. If one pop encounters an issue, others can take over, something harder to achieve in a single cloud region. Additionally, direct peering with local ISPs and internet exchanges allows us to route around problems and avoid congestion.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smarter-storage-keeping-what-makes-sense-in-the-cloud">Smarter Storage: Keeping What Makes Sense in the Cloud<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/PowerOfOurSovereignPlatform#smarter-storage-keeping-what-makes-sense-in-the-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smarter Storage: Keeping What Makes Sense in the Cloud" title="Direct link to Smarter Storage: Keeping What Makes Sense in the Cloud">​</a></h3>
<p>Building on the performance and reliability gains from our own infrastructure, we also examined which elements could still benefit from selective cloud use.</p>
<p>While we have intentionally avoided relying on the cloud for most workloads, we recognized there were areas where it made sense to use it. For certain functions, particularly long-term storage and archival, the cloud’s scale and cost-efficiency are hard to beat. Building our own global cold storage system would have been impractical given the large volume of archives and backups we manage, most of which are rarely accessed. Instead of investing in massive storage arrays, we use cost-effective cloud services such as S3 for bulk storage and AWS Glacier for deep archives.</p>
<p>This approach gives us the best of both worlds. We keep live, mission-critical systems under our control, while leveraging the cloud’s economies of scale for rarely accessed data. S3 provides affordable storage, and Glacier offers ultra-low-cost archival. The cost per terabyte is so low that it outcompetes running our own tape libraries or spinning disks, especially when factoring in maintenance and power.</p>
<p>We encrypt any sensitive data stored in the cloud with our own keys, addressing sovereignty concerns. For now, this mix of ownership and selective renting gives us maximum value: we control high-impact workloads and rent low-cost storage. As our needs grow, we will periodically revisit these decisions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cloudflare-partnership-and-appreciation">Cloudflare Partnership and Appreciation<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/PowerOfOurSovereignPlatform#cloudflare-partnership-and-appreciation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cloudflare Partnership and Appreciation" title="Direct link to Cloudflare Partnership and Appreciation">​</a></h3>
<p>While Cloudflare is a third-party provider, its role in our ecosystem complements rather than contradicts our sovereign approach. We regard it as a strategic ally whose services enhance rather than diminish our autonomy, operating as a neutral, globally distributed network layer under our configuration and control.</p>
<p>By leveraging their infrastructure without ceding ownership of our core systems, we extend our reach and resilience while preserving the independence central to our philosophy. From their innovative Project Galileo, which offers free protection to at-risk organizations, to robust load balancing and DDoS mitigation tools, Cloudflare’s services are deeply integrated into our stack. Their global network ensures fast, secure content delivery worldwide, and their fair, reasonable pricing keeps these advantages within reach for a nonprofit like ours.</p>
<p>In many ways, Cloudflare complements our sovereign infrastructure by adding another layer of resilience and reach.</p>
<p>We also recognize that there are moments when demand exceeds our own capacity. During major events such as presidential elections or sudden breaking news with massive audience spikes, we temporarily rely on external content delivery networks to help handle the load. This approach ensures that users continue to enjoy a seamless experience even when traffic surges unexpectedly. By combining our own infrastructure with these external resources only when necessary, we strike a balance between sovereignty, cost-effectiveness, and readiness for high-impact moments.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="empowering-media-guard-on-our-own-platform">Empowering Media Guard on Our Own Platform<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/PowerOfOurSovereignPlatform#empowering-media-guard-on-our-own-platform" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Empowering Media Guard on Our Own Platform" title="Direct link to Empowering Media Guard on Our Own Platform">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the biggest beneficiaries of our infrastructure is our Media Guard program, which provides technical infrastructure to independent media outlets worldwide. This includes satellite news downlinking, backhaul support, digital streaming, and content distribution. In essence, we serve as the backend backbone that helps keep news sites and streams online, even in challenging environments.</p>
<p>Many of our partners previously hosted their content on cloud or shared hosting platforms. As we integrate them into Media Guard, we transition them to our infrastructure, lowering latency, improving performance, and eliminating surprise bandwidth bills. Serving content from local PoPs instead of distant cloud regions improves user experience and reliability.</p>
<p>Owning the platform also lets us tailor support and protection. We can apply custom caching rules, DDoS protection, and high-availability setups to match each partner’s needs. In crisis situations, having control over the servers allows rapid response, rerouting traffic, provisioning extra capacity, or shielding at-risk sites. For partners facing cyberattacks or censorship, this can be life-saving.</p>
<p>Migrating partners from cloud setups to our PoPs is not simple, but our team provides hands-on support to ensure smooth transitions. This consolidation allows us to onboard more organizations without proportionally increasing costs, which is vital for our nonprofit model.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reinvesting-savings-into-growth-and-innovation">Reinvesting Savings into Growth and Innovation<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/PowerOfOurSovereignPlatform#reinvesting-savings-into-growth-and-innovation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reinvesting Savings into Growth and Innovation" title="Direct link to Reinvesting Savings into Growth and Innovation">​</a></h3>
<p>The savings from avoiding high cloud costs have allowed us to expand and innovate. We have been able to invest in new regions, such as launching the OpenIX Beirut project to localize internet infrastructure in Lebanon. We are also exploring new PoPs in other areas to improve local media connectivity.</p>
<p>We invested in our own GPU cluster, enabling us to run AI workloads in-house instead of paying for expensive cloud GPUs. This has allowed us to develop AI tools for our partner newsrooms, such as automatic video transcription, AI-based content moderation, and intelligent alert systems. These tools require significant compute power, which we can now provide ourselves.</p>
<p>Owning our infrastructure has also fostered a culture of optimization and experimentation. Our engineers understand the full stack, which sparks creative solutions. We can adopt new technologies at our own pace, without waiting for cloud vendor support.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oh-1-billion-notifications-monthly">Oh, 1 Billion Notifications Monthly<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/PowerOfOurSovereignPlatform#oh-1-billion-notifications-monthly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Oh, 1 Billion Notifications Monthly" title="Direct link to Oh, 1 Billion Notifications Monthly">​</a></h3>
<p>Back to where I began. When we started offering ONS to our partners, we knew how critical it was to deliver notifications quickly and reliably. We also wanted a solution we could deploy rapidly, and the cloud offered a quicker path to getting started without heavy upfront infrastructure work. Initially, we used Apache Pulsar through Stream Native, but as with other cloud services, costs grew quickly. Pulsar’s complexity also made it challenging to run in our fully independent, multi-region setup.</p>
<p>That changed when we discovered NATS, which we now run across all our regions. NATS has been transformative: lightweight, incredibly fast, and designed with simplicity and scalability in mind. Its built-in features for clustering, persistence, and streaming allow us to operate a truly distributed messaging system that matches our independent, multi-PoP architecture perfectly. NATS handles millions of messages per second with ease, giving us confidence that critical alerts will always get through.</p>
<p>With NATS, we are delivering 1 billion mobile notifications every month, a milestone that not only encapsulates the technical and strategic journey described from the outset, but also affirms the transformative impact of building and maintaining our sovereign infrastructure, from urgent evacuation orders and life-saving blood bank requests to traffic updates and breaking news alerts. The Open Notification Service has become a vital lifeline for the communities we serve and for our partners, enabling real-time communication that can improve safety, inform citizens, and even save lives. Whether it’s warning people in conflict zones, helping coordinate emergency responses, or simply keeping the public informed, ONS is proving how infrastructure choices directly impact human well-being.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://p.foundation/messages/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut"/>
        <updated>2025-05-13T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Launching Lebanon’s first carrier-neutral Internet Exchange Point to localize traffic and dramatically improve internet performance.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We initially envisioned OpenIX as a program that provides grants, training, technical assistance, and equipment to set up micro-efficient IXs—neutral hubs where networks openly peer and enjoy low-cost colocation. The vision was to bring internet content and service providers together locally, enabling data to be exchanged within Lebanon instead of traversing distant overseas hubs.</p>
<p>However, after extensive discussions with various stakeholders and recognizing the urgency and long-term value, we decided to take a more proactive approach. We are now directly initiating, operating, and maintaining OpenIX Beirut, committing fully to this endeavor for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Our goal is for OpenIX Beirut to become Lebanon’s first truly carrier-neutral Internet Exchange, significantly enhancing the nation’s internet infrastructure.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lebanon-needs-a-local-ix">Lebanon Needs a Local IX<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut#lebanon-needs-a-local-ix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lebanon Needs a Local IX" title="Direct link to Lebanon Needs a Local IX">​</a></h2>
<p>Lebanon currently lacks any active IX, forcing local internet traffic to traverse international routes unnecessarily. The country’s previous two exchange points, including Beirut-IX launched in 2007, never scaled effectively and are now defunct. Consequently, even when Lebanese users access local content, the data frequently travels thousands of kilometers to Europe and back, typically via Marseille or Paris, just to reach a nearby network. Although major content providers have recently installed local caches, historically most traffic has been routed via Europe due to the national backbone (Ogero) primarily connecting there. Such indirect paths add substantial latency (~50 milliseconds round-trip), degrade user experience, and inflate transit costs for ISPs.</p>
<p>This challenge extends beyond Lebanon, reflecting a broader regional issue. Internet exchange infrastructure in the Middle East and Africa remains underdeveloped, resulting in excessive overseas routing, higher costs, and slower speeds. As of 2021, about 83% of Middle Eastern internet bandwidth was routed through Europe. Many countries rely on European exchange points like Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, and Paris/Marseille, highlighting the stark performance gap compared to regions with established local IXs. Lebanon's situation, where even intra-country data loops through Europe, clearly demonstrates the critical need for a local IX.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-neutral-micro-efficient-ixs">Open, Neutral, Micro-Efficient IXs<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut#open-neutral-micro-efficient-ixs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open, Neutral, Micro-Efficient IXs" title="Direct link to Open, Neutral, Micro-Efficient IXs">​</a></h2>
<p>OpenIX represents P Foundation’s commitment to addressing this problem by establishing efficient, impactful IXs in underserved areas. Key features of OpenIX Beirut include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grants &amp; Equipment: Funding and donated hardware (switches, routers, etc.) to fully equip the exchange.</li>
<li>Training &amp; Technical Assistance: Expert guidance on IX operations, BGP peering arrangements, and exchange management best practices.</li>
<li>Carrier-Neutral Colocation: A neutral, affordable facility for all network operators, ensuring no single ISP or telco dominates.</li>
<li>Open Peering Policy: Freely accessible peering for all participants, promoting maximum interconnection among ISPs, content providers, educational institutions, and others.</li>
<li>Micro-Efficiency: Compact, optimized infrastructure delivering high performance sustainably with minimal footprint and costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenIX Beirut brings the exchange closer to users, eliminating the need for Lebanese traffic to travel through distant hubs. This will dramatically reduce latency (by tens of milliseconds per packet) and significantly lower IP transit costs for local ISPs. Importantly, a neutral IX reduces dependency on any single upstream provider, enhancing the resilience of Lebanon’s internet connectivity.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lebanons-chance-to-catch-up">Lebanon’s Chance to Catch Up<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut#lebanons-chance-to-catch-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lebanon’s Chance to Catch Up" title="Direct link to Lebanon’s Chance to Catch Up">​</a></h2>
<p>Internet Exchange Points have long been integral to internet growth. Many global IXs began as community or academic projects, with the first established in 1988 at a university campus. These early IXs demonstrated the benefits of local interconnection: faster, cheaper access for everyone. Major tech hubs worldwide—such as Silicon Valley and Amsterdam—now thrive due to robust IXs handling substantial local traffic.</p>
<p>However, the Middle East and Africa remain largely underserved in terms of IXs. Lebanon’s first attempt in 2007 at the American University of Beirut showed promise but faltered due to limited participation. Today, Lebanon still lacks a fully functional IX, exacerbating its digital divide through heavy dependence on international bandwidth. OpenIX Beirut aims to transform this landscape, placing Lebanon firmly on the map of globally connected internet communities.</p>
<p>We are confident this model works. For example, Kenya and Nigeria increased local traffic exchange from about 30% to 70% within eight years by developing strong IXs. Inspired by these success stories, our ambitious goal is to achieve over 70% local traffic exchange in Lebanon by Summer 2025. This means everything—from videos to financial transactions and academic resources—will reach users locally without leaving the country.</p>
<p><em>With OpenIX Beirut, local ISPs and content providers will directly exchange traffic within Lebanon, significantly boosting speed, reliability, and efficiency.</em></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="timeline-and-expectations">Timeline and Expectations<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut#timeline-and-expectations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Timeline and Expectations" title="Direct link to Timeline and Expectations">​</a></h2>
<p>After extensive planning, OpenIX Beirut is officially underway. Key milestones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>May 2025</strong>: Establishing governance and technical setup through collaboration with local stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>June 2025</strong>: Hardware delivery and establishment of local fiber connectivity.</li>
<li><strong>July 2025</strong>: Initial participation from 9 of Lebanon's 14 major ISPs (representing 40% of the market) and multiple content providers.</li>
<li><strong>Summer 2025</strong>: Expanding participation to 13 of the 14 major ISPs.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond 2025</strong>: Ongoing expansion, capacity upgrades, and gradual transition to community-led governance.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Lebanese internet users, these developments mean tangible improvements: faster website loading, smoother streaming, and lower latency in gaming. Local hosting will become viable, freeing up costly international bandwidth for essential overseas traffic.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community-impact">Community Impact<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut#community-impact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community Impact" title="Direct link to Community Impact">​</a></h2>
<p>The launch of OpenIX Beirut marks more than just a technical improvement—it is a community milestone. It unites telecom operators, private ISPs, universities, and content companies in enhancing Lebanon’s digital ecosystem. Localized traffic means faster, more affordable, and resilient internet, benefitting everything from business services to education tools. Critically, local peering ensures continued domestic connectivity even if international routes face disruptions.</p>
<p>OpenIX Beirut also serves as a pilot for broader regional expansion. Our mission at P Foundation is to foster a more equitable, distributed internet, enabling every community to fully engage in the global digital economy.</p>
<p>We warmly invite all Lebanese ISPs, telecom carriers, content providers, and community networks to join OpenIX Beirut. The benefits of local peering—lower latency, reduced costs, enhanced user experiences—are immediate and substantial. Regional and global partners interested in supporting or participating are also encouraged to connect.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The past year has been one of immense growth and learning for our team and the communities we serve. We've made significant strides in building stronger networks, responding to emerging crises, and laying the groundwork for more impactful initiatives. Yet, as we reflect on our progress, it's clear that there is much more to be done. The journey has just begun, and the challenges we face in such a dynamic region demand continued adaptability, commitment, and courage. Our roadmap to 2027 isn't just a plan—it's a promise to keep pushing forward, to create lasting change.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/roadmap_to_2027#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h3>
<p>Every birthday brings with it a moment of reflection, a brief melancholy that pushes me to evaluate my journey so far. In 2021, as I approached my 30th birthday, the introspection was different. I found myself thinking not just about my past but also about my legacy. It wasn't just another birthday—it was a turning point.</p>
<p>I grew up in a Lebanese Christian household that resisted the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. We criticized the United States role in the situation, yet we understood that only the US had the power to change it. My father was a remarkable figure in my life, always instilling in me that there are no limits to what we can achieve, that we control our own destiny, and that our choices define us. Later, my brother played an even bigger role in shaping my worldview. He introduced me to different cultures, sects and unwittingly led me to the world of media. I had the unique opportunity to grow up in newsrooms—first at a radio station, then at a television network. This exposure, at such an early age, laid the foundation for everything I would do later.</p>
<p>In my younger years, I started out as a developer. I moved into the corporate world, but it didn’t take long for me to realize that it wasn’t where I belonged. I left to pursue commercial media independently, only to find myself eventually shifting toward communications. None of these transitions were planned; they happened because I saw a goal worth pursuing in each new phase.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lebanon was enduring its third year of a deepening financial crisis. Poverty was on the rise, infrastructure was crumbling, and basic services were failing. Some areas were dealing with daily internet blackouts, impacting not only households but essential services like medication distribution. Internet access had become a political bargaining chip, with politicians using it as leverage against the public.</p>
<p>As my 30th birthday approached, I knew I could no longer afford to move forward without a clear plan. I decided that I was done doing things that didn’t resonate with me. The best legacy, I believed, was one that left a positive impact on the community.
I am a firm believer that open internet access is as vital as education for the future of any nation. Free journalism is another pillar I stand by. Both of these beliefs converged on that introspective day, and before I knew it, I was filling out paperwork to register a foundation in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>I’ve always preferred working behind the scenes, and it was no different for the foundation. I didn't even bother to create a Twitter account for it. I focused on building a network that would serve as the backbone for our future endeavors. At the same time, I reached out to friends in media organizations, trying to understand their challenges and exploring ways to help. Parallel to this, we were tackling smaller but significant issues, such as minor internet outages in Lebanon. By working with different organizations, we aimed to keep people connected, even if that meant nudging entities to simply do their jobs or by integrating with their teams to directly address the challenges they faced.</p>
<p>The vision for the foundation took shape gradually. We began developing programs that addressed core challenges, while also stepping in with initiatives when crises struck. One such example was @LebanonAlerts, a small but impactful initiative which helped alleviate local fear and anxiety following the deadly 2023 earthquake in Turkey.</p>
<p>On October 7th, we woke up to news of a massacre in south Israel, only for certain groups in Lebanon to use the situation as a pretext to ignite tensions with Israel. By October 18th, we had prepared our media continuity plan, scaling up resources and preparing for a potential escalation between Israel and Hezbollah. Ensuring Lebanon’s continued access to the internet was a priority for us, and as we observed the Lebanese government's inadequate response, we put together a connectivity response plan and began communicating with relevant parties. Unfortunately, political complications led to our plan being sidelined - Hezbollah’s opposition being a major reason. Setbacks are an inevitable part of any meaningful journey, but we remain committed to ensuring that Lebanon stays connected.</p>
<p>Creating a traditional roadmap in such an unpredictable environment, especially in the Middle East where we operate, would be impractical. Instead, we need a flexible framework—one that could adapt to the ever-changing political and social landscape, allowing us to respond effectively to new challenges as they arise.With all these considerations, here are the key priorities and goals I envision for the next three years:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expand-our-partnerships">Expand our Partnerships<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/roadmap_to_2027#expand-our-partnerships" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expand our Partnerships" title="Direct link to Expand our Partnerships">​</a></h3>
<p>We aim to increase the number of beneficiaries of our programs by adding more organizations to our MediaGuard initiative. Transitioning infrastructure is not an easy task, especially for organizations with small digital teams—often consisting of just one system administrator, if not outsourced. To facilitate this transition, we plan to offer more personalized, one-on-one support and a dedicated point of contact to improve efficiency and ensure a smoother migration process.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strengthen-citizen-focused-programs-and-initiatives">Strengthen Citizen-Focused Programs and Initiatives<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/roadmap_to_2027#strengthen-citizen-focused-programs-and-initiatives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Strengthen Citizen-Focused Programs and Initiatives" title="Direct link to Strengthen Citizen-Focused Programs and Initiatives">​</a></h3>
<p>By collaborating closely with various stakeholders, we see opportunities to offer more tools, utilities, and integrated support, particularly to existing organizations that directly serve citizens. Our goal is to deepen our partnerships with organizations that have significant grassroots experience and direct impact on citizens' lives. By doing so, we can better address community needs and enhance the support provided to individuals on the ground.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="forward-deployed-software-engineer-model">Forward Deployed Software Engineer Model<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/roadmap_to_2027#forward-deployed-software-engineer-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Forward Deployed Software Engineer Model" title="Direct link to Forward Deployed Software Engineer Model">​</a></h3>
<p>I am a strong advocate of the Forward Deployed Software Engineer (FDSE) role and model, originally popularized by Palantir. This approach blends software engineering expertise with direct client engagement, allowing for rapid problem-solving and effective integration. By adopting this model, we can address issues more quickly and provide end-to-end solutions for the challenges faced by our partners.</p>
<p>Until now, I have personally integrated with every new partner—working alongside them throughout various stages, joining internal scrum calls, and collaborating closely with their developers, system administrators, management, and other teams to create solutions that meet everyone's needs.</p>
<p>The talent pool for Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSE) is currently very limited, if not non-existent, in the Middle East. I see a significant opportunity to transform this gap into a structured program or initiative. Such a program would foster creativity, technical problem-solving, and a collaborative mindset, equipping software engineers with the skills to adapt to rapid project changes and make independent decisions effectively.</p>

<p>Through my close integration with various partners, I have identified several key services and integrations that they continually struggle with. These range from basic functionalities, such as managing and scaling push notification services, to more complex, deeply-rooted challenges within their newsrooms.</p>
<p>By leveraging advancements in machine learning—often referred to as "AI"—we have managed to accelerate our development processes without expanding our team excessively. This approach allows us to release features more rapidly and introduce new functionalities at a greater pace.
Building on these advancements, we aim to expand our programs with additional offerings, enhancing the support we provide to our partners and addressing their most pressing needs.</p>
<p>One might think that three years is plenty of time to achieve these goals—and it certainly seems that way. However, given the ever-changing dynamics of the Middle East, this is ultimately a long-term vision for what we hope to accomplish.</p>
<p>Stay safe,<br>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the escalating potential for military conflict in Lebanon, the P Foundation has activated its crisis response plan. This initiative is undertaken in close partnership with the Lebanese Ministry of Telecom, and local organizations.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://p.foundation/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan">MediaGuard Continuity Plan</a>, this plan augments the existing P Foundation programs, enhancing their capacity and introducing new services.</p>
<p>While our objective is to mitigate Lebanon's disconnection from the global internet, we recognize the limitations posed by our resources in achieving this goal entirely.</p>
<p>Upon completing all allocations related to ResilientNet, and with the onset of any conflict, we will broaden our Citizen Mesh program to assist other communities.</p>
<p>In adherence to regulatory mandates, all internet traffic facilitated through our deployment will be channeled through the P Foundation Network (AS322728).</p>

<p>The P Foundation deeply acknowledges the transformative essence of connectivity. Internet access during conflicts acts as a channel for information dissemination, public engagement, and global cognizance, thus underscoring the resilience of internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>Internet access during conflicts serve as a conduit for information warfare, public engagement, and global awareness. The digital landscape facilitates real-time updates and citizen-driven narratives, contributing to a broader understanding and sometimes humanitarian response to the unfolding crisis. Moreover, the resilience of internet infrastructure underlines its significance in maintaining communication channels, while also spotlighting issues surrounding digital rights, cybersecurity, and narrative control in such geopolitical confrontations.</p>
<p>Our crisis response extends our Citizen Mesh program, incorporating multiple open access services.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="emergency-internet-connectivity-zones-eiczs">Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs)<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan#emergency-internet-connectivity-zones-eiczs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs)" title="Direct link to Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs)">​</a></h3>
<p>_Pending MOU with LRC _</p>
<p>In collaboration with local partners, and P Foundation volunteers, we aim to establish over 50 Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs) across secure Lebanese territories in the event of a conflict, prioritizing areas with a high influx of displaced individuals and erratic internet access.</p>
<p>Each zone is equipped with multiple WiFi access points, facilitating easy internet access for the public.</p>
<p>These zones are solar-powered and designed to provide internet connectivity for at least 18 hours a day. During daylight hours, each zone is equipped with power cords allowing the public to charge their devices.</p>
<p>If mandated by Lebanese Authorities, individuals accessing the internet via the EICZs may be required to register and verify their identity before connecting.</p>
<p>The list of active EICZs will be available on our website, as well as on social channels.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="additional-information">Additional Information<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan#additional-information" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Additional Information" title="Direct link to Additional Information">​</a></h4>
<p>To cater to the maximum number of users, we employ real-time internet quality monitoring. During periods of peak usage, access to video and streaming services may be restricted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the service is provided in public spaces, we utilize Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 service to safeguard families by blocking access to malware and adult content.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mobile-internet-connectivity-zones">Mobile Internet Connectivity Zones<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan#mobile-internet-connectivity-zones" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mobile Internet Connectivity Zones" title="Direct link to Mobile Internet Connectivity Zones">​</a></h3>
<p>Similar to EICZs, we have prepared 2 Mobile EICZs (MICZs) ready for deployment to locations that necessitate vital internet access following certain events.</p>
<p>The MICZs utilize specialized mobile hardware that facilitates immediate internet deployment, providing access via both WiFi and ethernet.</p>
<p>We anticipate that individuals will utilize MICZs to connect with family and friends, reassuring them of their safety. Additionally, media organizations can leverage MICZs as a backup for their live reporting.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given the recent escalaction in Gaza, we perceive an escalating risk of military conflict between Israel and Lebanon.</p>
<p>We're concerned that many media outlets, despite having business continuity plans, may be underestimating the scale of a potential conflict.</p>
<p>In response, we are redoubling our efforts through our <a href="https://p.foundation/programs">MediaGuard</a> program, which has been steadfastly supporting journalists and media organizations for the past 18 months—all at no cost.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://p.foundation/programs">MediaGuard</a> program exemplifies our commitment to fortifying media organizations worldwide by offering a range of customized, free-of-charge services such as backhaul support, downlinking, digital streaming, and content distribution.</p>
<p>Central to MediaGuard's mission is aiding media organizations in achieving and maintaining operational stability. Consequently, P Foundation is extending various specialized services through MediaGuard in the event of conflict, also free of charge.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-tv-broadcasters">For TV Broadcasters<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan#for-tv-broadcasters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to For TV Broadcasters" title="Direct link to For TV Broadcasters">​</a></h2>

<p>Although an internet blackout may not occur immediately, we anticipate that it could become a reality if the conflict lasts longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>While most tv broadcaster in Lebanon use IP for their backhaul, we believe they all also maintain a satellite backup. We urge all broadcasters to ensure that their satellite backup is operational.</p>
<p>In addition to the satellite backup, we have expanded our computing capacities in both London and New York which would allow us to allocate enough resources for all broadcasters to maintain a backup playout in case of emergency. We recommend that you upload backup content from now instead of waiting for last minute. Please communicate your requirements to your contact point, and we will allocate the necessary resources.</p>
<p>Our infrastructure includes Zixi encoders in both locations and we maintains an open channel with Arabsat NOC, enabling broadcasters to switch to a backup within minutes of any outage.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="live-streaming">Live Streaming<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan#live-streaming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Live Streaming" title="Direct link to Live Streaming">​</a></h3>
<p>Live broadcasts are crucial news sources during conflicts.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that media organizations shift their digital streaming to utilize offshore facilities. If you don't have one ready, our Spain-based facilities can downlink most beams from Arabsat and Nilesat, and we are able to allocate resources for you to stream from there. Please reach out to your contact point at PF to arrange.</p>
<p>We are also enabling our MediaGuard dashboard for all broadcasters to downlink their feeds and restream them to their content distribution partners and social platforms.</p>
<p>With an anticipated surge in online viewership, we advise broadcasters to expand their live streaming to additional platforms like YouTube, Rumble, and X.</p>
<p>For those experiencing growing viewership on their proprietary platforms and unable to switch to others, we've partnere with multiple CDNs and we are able to increase the free content distribution limit from 100TB a month to 1PB.</p>

<p>It is typical for any military conflict to extend to the cyberspace, and this was <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-israel-and-palestine-following-the-october-2023-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evident</a> in Gaza and Israel past few days. We expect the same to happen in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Along with traditional DDOS attack, we expect an increase in phishing attacks on journalists and media organizations. We urge all media organizations to be extra vigilant and send a reminder to all staff to be extra cautious when opening emails and clicking on links, specially their digital teams.</p>
<p>While most organisations already use Cloudflare, we believe some have had security gaps that left their origins exposed and vulnerable to attacks. If you are not sure about your security setup, please reach out to your contact point at PF and we will help you assess your setup and make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>We recommend that you increase your replication resources or maintain hourly backups. If your provider support ransom protection, that we definitely recommend that you enable it.</p>
<p>In addition, we have increased our capacity in DC, and we are able to accomodate most media platforms. If you think that you are likely to be targeted and you prefer to move your website to our isolated infrastructure, please reach out to your contact points at PF and we will help you with the migration.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shared-working-space">Shared Working Space<a href="https://p.foundation/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan#shared-working-space" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shared Working Space" title="Direct link to Shared Working Space">​</a></h3>
<p>We recognize that not all media organizations have their own facilities or contingency plans. To address this, we've set up a 300-square-meter shared working space in a designated "safe area."</p>
<p>Designed to accommodate 35-40 people at a time, the space has sufficient diesel reserves to offer continuous power for up to 45 days. It also features multiple backhauls to ensure a stable internet connection.</p>
<p>Though the facility is open to all journalists, we request that you contact us via Discord or email (<a href="mailto:mediaguard@p.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mediaguard@p.foundation</a>) and include copies of IDs or Passports for those planning to use the facility.</p>]]></content>
