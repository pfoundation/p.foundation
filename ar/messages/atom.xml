        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[P Foundation crisis response plan in case of military conflict in Lebanon.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the escalating potential for military conflict in Lebanon, the P Foundation has activated its crisis response plan. This initiative is undertaken in close partnership with the Lebanese Ministry of Telecom, and local organizations.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan">MediaGuard Continuity Plan</a>, this plan augments the existing P Foundation programs, enhancing their capacity and introducing new services.</p>
<p>While our objective is to mitigate Lebanon's disconnection from the global internet, we recognize the limitations posed by our resources in achieving this goal entirely.</p>
<p>Upon completing all allocations related to ResilientNet, and with the onset of any conflict, we will broaden our Citizen Mesh program to assist other communities.</p>
<p>In adherence to regulatory mandates, all internet traffic facilitated through our deployment will be channeled through the P Foundation Network (AS322728).</p>

<p>ResilientNet aims to maintain internet connectivity for critical establishments imperative for public welfare.</p>
<p>Central to this program is a meticulous, needs-based assessment methodology, tailored to discern the distinct connectivity requisites of each targeted critical establishment.</p>
<p>Although we have streamlined the assessment process typically applied, our deployment priority is directed towards first responders, medical facilities, and select public establishments.</p>

<p>Each entity entitled to ResilientNet (through Ministry of Telecommunications) must submit a request using the webform or by email to <a href="mailto:crisisresponse@p.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crisisresponse@p.foundation</a>, including the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the organization</li>
<li>Number of people benefiting from the service (if applicable)</li>
<li>Internet access requirement (e.g. speed, wifi, lan, bgp, dedicated ip, ...)</li>
<li>Network Reuqirement</li>
<li>Location of facility, including coordinates or a Google Maps link (The service will be limited mentioned location.)</li>
<li>Point of Contact</li>
<li>Technical Point of Contact</li>
<li>Upon receiving your request, we will review all the provided information and forward it to the Ministry of Telecom for approval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once approved, the required devices will be allocated to you for collection, and you will be added to relevant messaging groups to assist you with the setup.</p>
<p>While the hardware is in your possession, it is your responsibility to maintain and safeguard it, ensuring its return in the same condition it was received.</p>

<p>The P Foundation deeply acknowledges the transformative essence of connectivity. Internet access during conflicts acts as a channel for information dissemination, public engagement, and global cognizance, thus underscoring the resilience of internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>Internet access during conflicts serve as a conduit for information warfare, public engagement, and global awareness. The digital landscape facilitates real-time updates and citizen-driven narratives, contributing to a broader understanding and sometimes humanitarian response to the unfolding crisis. Moreover, the resilience of internet infrastructure underlines its significance in maintaining communication channels, while also spotlighting issues surrounding digital rights, cybersecurity, and narrative control in such geopolitical confrontations.</p>
<p>Our crisis response extends our Citizen Mesh program, incorporating multiple open access services.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="emergency-internet-connectivity-zones-eiczs">Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs)<a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan#emergency-internet-connectivity-zones-eiczs" class="hash-link" aria-label="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs)" title="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs)">​</a></h3>
<p>_Pending MOU with LRC _</p>
<p>In collaboration with local partners, and P Foundation volunteers, we aim to establish over 50 Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs) across secure Lebanese territories in the event of a conflict, prioritizing areas with a high influx of displaced individuals and erratic internet access.</p>
<p>Each zone is equipped with multiple WiFi access points, facilitating easy internet access for the public.</p>
<p>These zones are solar-powered and designed to provide internet connectivity for at least 18 hours a day. During daylight hours, each zone is equipped with power cords allowing the public to charge their devices.</p>
<p>If mandated by Lebanese Authorities, individuals accessing the internet via the EICZs may be required to register and verify their identity before connecting.</p>
<p>The list of active EICZs will be available on our website, as well as on social channels.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="additional-information">Additional Information<a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan#additional-information" class="hash-link" aria-label="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Additional Information" title="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Additional Information">​</a></h4>
<p>To cater to the maximum number of users, we employ real-time internet quality monitoring. During periods of peak usage, access to video and streaming services may be restricted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the service is provided in public spaces, we utilize Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 service to safeguard families by blocking access to malware and adult content.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mobile-internet-connectivity-zones">Mobile Internet Connectivity Zones<a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan#mobile-internet-connectivity-zones" class="hash-link" aria-label="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Mobile Internet Connectivity Zones" title="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Mobile Internet Connectivity Zones">​</a></h3>
<p>Similar to EICZs, we have prepared 2 Mobile EICZs (MICZs) ready for deployment to locations that necessitate vital internet access following certain events.</p>
<p>The MICZs utilize specialized mobile hardware that facilitates immediate internet deployment, providing access via both WiFi and ethernet.</p>
<p>We anticipate that individuals will utilize MICZs to connect with family and friends, reassuring them of their safety. Additionally, media organizations can leverage MICZs as a backup for their live reporting.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="post-conflict-assignment">Post Conflict Assignment<a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan#post-conflict-assignment" class="hash-link" aria-label="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Post Conflict Assignment" title="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Post Conflict Assignment">​</a></h3>
<p>Following the conclusion of the conflict, and as displaced individuals begin to return to their hometowns, the EICZs can be dynamically relocated to provide connectivity while Ogero continues to restore the damaged infrastructure.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given the recent escalaction in Gaza, we perceive an escalating risk of military conflict between Israel and Lebanon.</p>
<p>We're concerned that many media outlets, despite having business continuity plans, may be underestimating the scale of a potential conflict.</p>
<p>In response, we are redoubling our efforts through our <a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/programs">MediaGuard</a> program, which has been steadfastly supporting journalists and media organizations for the past 18 months—all at no cost.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/programs">MediaGuard</a> program exemplifies our commitment to fortifying media organizations worldwide by offering a range of customized, free-of-charge services such as backhaul support, downlinking, digital streaming, and content distribution.</p>
<p>Central to MediaGuard's mission is aiding media organizations in achieving and maintaining operational stability. Consequently, P Foundation is extending various specialized services through MediaGuard in the event of conflict, also free of charge.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-tv-broadcasters">For TV Broadcasters<a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan#for-tv-broadcasters" class="hash-link" aria-label="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان For TV Broadcasters" title="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان For TV Broadcasters">​</a></h2>

<p>Although an internet blackout may not occur immediately, we anticipate that it could become a reality if the conflict lasts longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>While most tv broadcaster in Lebanon use IP for their backhaul, we believe they all also maintain a satellite backup. We urge all broadcasters to ensure that their satellite backup is operational.</p>
<p>In addition to the satellite backup, we have expanded our computing capacities in both London and New York which would allow us to allocate enough resources for all broadcasters to maintain a backup playout in case of emergency. We recommend that you upload backup content from now instead of waiting for last minute. Please communicate your requirements to your contact point, and we will allocate the necessary resources.</p>
<p>Our infrastructure includes Zixi encoders in both locations and we maintains an open channel with Arabsat NOC, enabling broadcasters to switch to a backup within minutes of any outage.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="live-streaming">Live Streaming<a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan#live-streaming" class="hash-link" aria-label="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Live Streaming" title="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Live Streaming">​</a></h3>
<p>Live broadcasts are crucial news sources during conflicts.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that media organizations shift their digital streaming to utilize offshore facilities. If you don't have one ready, our Spain-based facilities can downlink most beams from Arabsat and Nilesat, and we are able to allocate resources for you to stream from there. Please reach out to your contact point at PF to arrange.</p>
<p>We are also enabling our MediaGuard dashboard for all broadcasters to downlink their feeds and restream them to their content distribution partners and social platforms.</p>
<p>With an anticipated surge in online viewership, we advise broadcasters to expand their live streaming to additional platforms like YouTube, Rumble, and X.</p>
<p>For those experiencing growing viewership on their proprietary platforms and unable to switch to others, we've partnere with multiple CDNs and we are able to increase the free content distribution limit from 100TB a month to 1PB.</p>

<p>It is typical for any military conflict to extend to the cyberspace, and this was <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-israel-and-palestine-following-the-october-2023-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evident</a> in Gaza and Israel past few days. We expect the same to happen in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Along with traditional DDOS attack, we expect an increase in phishing attacks on journalists and media organizations. We urge all media organizations to be extra vigilant and send a reminder to all staff to be extra cautious when opening emails and clicking on links, specially their digital teams.</p>
<p>While most organisations already use Cloudflare, we believe some have had security gaps that left their origins exposed and vulnerable to attacks. If you are not sure about your security setup, please reach out to your contact point at PF and we will help you assess your setup and make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>We recommend that you increase your replication resources or maintain hourly backups. If your provider support ransom protection, that we definitely recommend that you enable it.</p>
<p>In addition, we have increased our capacity in DC, and we are able to accomodate most media platforms. If you think that you are likely to be targeted and you prefer to move your website to our isolated infrastructure, please reach out to your contact points at PF and we will help you with the migration.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shared-working-space">Shared Working Space<a href="https://www.p.foundation/ar/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan#shared-working-space" class="hash-link" aria-label="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Shared Working Space" title="ارتباط مباشر بالعنوان Shared Working Space">​</a></h3>
<p>We recognize that not all media organizations have their own facilities or contingency plans. To address this, we've set up a 300-square-meter shared working space in a designated "safe area."</p>
<p>Designed to accommodate 35-40 people at a time, the space has sufficient diesel reserves to offer continuous power for up to 45 days. It also features multiple backhauls to ensure a stable internet connection.</p>
<p>Though the facility is open to all journalists, we request that you contact us via Discord or email (<a href="mailto:mediaguard@p.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mediaguard@p.foundation</a>) and include copies of IDs or Passports for those planning to use the facility.</p>]]></content>
