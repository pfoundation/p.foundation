It wasn't just another birthday\u2014it was a turning point."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I grew up in a Lebanese Christian household that resisted the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. We criticized the United States role in the situation, yet we understood that only the US had the power to change it. My father was a remarkable figure in my life, always instilling in me that there are no limits to what we can achieve, that we control our own destiny, and that our choices define us. Later, my brother played an even bigger role in shaping my worldview. He introduced me to different cultures, sects and unwittingly led me to the world of media. I had the unique opportunity to grow up in newsrooms\u2014first at a radio station, then at a television network. This exposure, at such an early age, laid the foundation for everything I would do later."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In my younger years, I started out as a developer. I moved into the corporate world, but it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that it wasn\u2019t where I belonged.

None of these transitions were planned; they happened because I saw a goal worth pursuing in each new phase."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Meanwhile, Lebanon was enduring its third year of a deepening financial crisis.

I decided that I was done doing things that didn\u2019t resonate with me.

At the same time, I reached out to friends in media organizations, trying to understand their challenges and exploring ways to help. Parallel to this, we were tackling smaller but significant issues, such as minor internet outages in Lebanon.

Ensuring Lebanon\u2019s continued access to the internet was a priority for us, and as we observed the Lebanese government's inadequate response, we put together a connectivity response plan and began communicating with relevant parties. Unfortunately, political complications led to our plan being sidelined - Hezbollah\u2019s opposition being a major reason.
