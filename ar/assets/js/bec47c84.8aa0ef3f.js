In 2021, as I approached my 30th birthday, the introspection was different. I found myself thinking not just about my past but also about my legacy. It wasn\'t just another birthday\u2014it was a turning point.\\n\\nI grew up in a Lebanese Christian household that resisted the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. We criticized the United States role in the situation, yet we understood that only the US had the power to change it. My father was a remarkable figure in my life, always instilling in me that there are no limits to what we can achieve, that we control our own destiny, and that our choices define us. Later, my brother played an even bigger role in shaping my worldview. He introduced me to different cultures, sects and unwittingly led me to the world of media. I had the unique opportunity to grow up in newsrooms\u2014first at a radio station, then at a television network. This exposure, at such an early age, laid the foundation for everything I would do later.\\n\\nIn my younger years, I started out as a developer. I moved into the corporate world, but it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that it wasn\u2019t where I belonged. I left to pursue commercial media independently, only to find myself eventually shifting toward communications. None of these transitions were planned; they happened because I saw a goal worth pursuing in each new phase.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lebanon was enduring its third year of a deepening financial crisis. Poverty was on the rise, infrastructure was crumbling, and basic services were failing. Some areas were dealing with daily internet blackouts, impacting not only households but essential services like medication distribution. Internet access had become a political bargaining chip, with politicians using it as leverage against the public.\\n\\nAs my 30th birthday approached, I knew I could no longer afford to move forward without a clear plan. I decided that I was done doing things that didn\u2019t resonate with me. The best legacy, I believed, was one that left a positive impact on the community.\\nI am a firm believer that open internet access is as vital as education for the future of any nation. Free journalism is another pillar I stand by. Both of these beliefs converged on that introspective day, and before I knew it, I was filling out paperwork to register a foundation in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nI\u2019ve always preferred working behind the scenes, and it was no different for the foundation. I didn\'t even bother to create a Twitter account for it. I focused on building a network that would serve as the backbone for our future endeavors. At the same time, I reached out to friends in media organizations, trying to understand their challenges and exploring ways to help. Parallel to this, we were tackling smaller but significant issues, such as minor internet outages in Lebanon. By working with different organizations, we aimed to keep people connected, even if that meant nudging entities to simply do their jobs or by integrating with their teams to directly address the challenges they faced.\\n\\nThe vision for the foundation took shape gradually. We began developing programs that addressed core challenges, while also stepping in with initiatives when crises struck. One such example was @LebanonAlerts, a small but impactful initiative which helped alleviate local fear and anxiety following the deadly 2023 earthquake in Turkey.\\n\\nOn October 7th, we woke up to news of a massacre in south Israel, only for certain groups in Lebanon to use the situation as a pretext to ignite tensions with Israel. By October 18th, we had prepared our media continuity plan, scaling up resources and preparing for a potential escalation between Israel and Hezbollah. Ensuring Lebanon\u2019s continued access to the internet was a priority for us, and as we observed the Lebanese government\'s inadequate response, we put together a connectivity response plan and began communicating with relevant parties. Unfortunately, political complications led to our plan being sidelined - Hezbollah\u2019s opposition being a major reason. Setbacks are an inevitable part of any meaningful journey, but we remain committed to ensuring that Lebanon stays connected.\\n\\nCreating a traditional roadmap in such an unpredictable environment, especially in the Middle East where we operate, would be impractical. Instead, we need a flexible framework\u2014one that could adapt to the ever-changing political and social landscape, allowing us to respond effectively to new challenges as they arise.With all these considerations, here are the key priorities and goals I envision for the next three years:\\n\\n### Expand our Partnerships\\n\\nWe aim to increase the number of beneficiaries of our programs by adding more organizations to our MediaGuard initiative. Transitioning infrastructure is not an easy task, especially for organizations with small digital teams\u2014often consisting of just one system administrator, if not outsourced. To facilitate this transition, we plan to offer more personalized, one-on-one support and a dedicated point of contact to improve efficiency and ensure a smoother migration process.\\n\\n### Strengthen Citizen-Focused Programs and Initiatives\\n\\nBy collaborating closely with various stakeholders, we see opportunities to offer more tools, utilities, and integrated support, particularly to existing organizations that directly serve citizens. Our goal is to deepen our partnerships with organizations that have significant grassroots experience and direct impact on citizens\' lives. By doing so, we can better address community needs and enhance the support provided to individuals on the ground.\\n\\n### Forward Deployed Software Engineer Model\\n\\nI am a strong advocate of the Forward Deployed Software Engineer (FDSE) role and model, originally popularized by Palantir. This approach blends software engineering expertise with direct client engagement, allowing for rapid problem-solving and effective integration. By adopting this model, we can address issues more quickly and provide end-to-end solutions for the challenges faced by our partners.\\n\\nUntil now, I have personally integrated with every new partner\u2014working alongside them throughout various stages, joining internal scrum calls, and collaborating closely with their developers, system administrators, management, and other teams to create solutions that meet everyone\'s needs.\\n\\nThe talent pool for Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSE) is currently very limited, if not non-existent, in the Middle East. I see a significant opportunity to transform this gap into a structured program or initiative. Such a program would foster creativity, technical problem-solving, and a collaborative mindset, equipping software engineers with the skills to adapt to rapid project changes and make independent decisions effectively.\\n\\n### Expanding Our Programs\\n\\nThrough my close integration with various partners, I have identified several key services and integrations that they continually struggle with. These range from basic functionalities, such as managing and scaling push notification services, to more complex, deeply-rooted challenges within their newsrooms.\\n\\nBy leveraging advancements in machine learning\u2014often referred to as \\"AI\\"\u2014we have managed to accelerate our development processes without expanding our team excessively. This approach allows us to release features more rapidly and introduce new functionalities at a greater pace.\\nBuilding on these advancements, we aim to expand our programs with additional offerings, enhancing the support we provide to our partners and addressing their most pressing needs.\\n\\nOne might think that three years is plenty of time to achieve these goals\u2014and it certainly seems that way. However, given the ever-changing dynamics of the Middle East, this is ultimately a long-term vision for what we hope to accomplish.\\n\\nStay safe,\\nJud"},{"id":"lebanon_crisis_response_plan","metadata":{"permalink":"/ar/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan","source":"@site/messages/2023-10-31-crisis_response_plan.md","title":"Lebanon Crisis Response Plan","description":"P Foundation crisis response plan in case of military conflict in Lebanon.","date":"2023-10-31T08:20:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":5.245,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jud Saoud","title":"COO of P Foundation","email":"jud@p.foundation","imageURL":"https://github.com/judsd.png","key":"jud"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Lebanon Crisis Response Plan","description":"P Foundation crisis response plan in case of military conflict in Lebanon.","slug":"lebanon_crisis_response_plan","authors":"jud","hide_table_of_contents":false,"date":"2023-10-31T08:20:00.000Z","last_update":{"date":"2023-11-29T19:00:00.000Z"}},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1701284400000,"prevItem":{"title":"Roadmap to 2027","permalink":"/ar/messages/roadmap_to_2027"},"nextItem":{"title":"MediaGuard Continuity Plan for Lebanon Conflict","permalink":"/ar/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan"}},"content":"With the escalating potential for military conflict in Lebanon, the P Foundation has activated its crisis response plan.

Internet access during conflicts acts as a channel for information dissemination, public engagement, and global cognizance, thus underscoring the resilience of internet infrastructure.\\n\\nInternet access during conflicts serve as a conduit for information warfare, public engagement, and global awareness. The digital landscape facilitates real-time updates and citizen-driven narratives, contributing to a broader understanding and sometimes humanitarian response to the unfolding crisis. Moreover, the resilience of internet infrastructure underlines its significance in maintaining communication channels, while also spotlighting issues surrounding digital rights, cybersecurity, and narrative control in such geopolitical confrontations.\\n\\nOur crisis response extends our Citizen Mesh program, incorporating multiple open access services.\\n\\n### Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs)\\n\\n_Pending MOU with LRC _\\n\\nIn collaboration with local partners, and P Foundation volunteers, we aim to establish over 50 Emergency Internet Connectivity Zones (EICZs) across secure Lebanese territories in the event of a conflict, prioritizing areas with a high influx of displaced individuals and erratic internet access.\\n\\nEach zone is equipped with multiple WiFi access points, facilitating easy internet access for the public.\\n\\nThese zones are solar-powered and designed to provide internet connectivity for at least 18 hours a day. During daylight hours, each zone is equipped with power cords allowing the public to charge their devices.\\n\\nIf mandated by Lebanese Authorities, individuals accessing the internet via the EICZs may be required to register and verify their identity before connecting.\\n\\nThe list of active EICZs will be available on our website, as well as on social channels.\\n\\n#### Additional Information\\n\\nTo cater to the maximum number of users, we employ real-time internet quality monitoring. During periods of peak usage, access to video and streaming services may be restricted.\\n\\nFurthermore, since the service is provided in public spaces, we utilize Cloudflare\'s 1.1.1.1 service to safeguard families by blocking access to malware and adult content.\\n\\n### Mobile Internet Connectivity Zones\\n\\nSimilar to EICZs, we have prepared 2 Mobile EICZs (MICZs) ready for deployment to locations that necessitate vital internet access following certain events.\\n\\nThe MICZs utilize specialized mobile hardware that facilitates immediate internet deployment, providing access via both WiFi and ethernet.\\n\\nWe anticipate that individuals will utilize MICZs to connect with family and friends, reassuring them of their safety. Additionally, media organizations can leverage MICZs as a backup for their live reporting.\\n\\n### Post Conflict Assignment\\n\\nFollowing the conclusion of the conflict, and as displaced individuals begin to return to their hometowns, the EICZs can be dynamically relocated to provide connectivity while Ogero continues to restore the damaged infrastructure.\\n\\n## Change Log\\n\\n**11/29/23 17:00**\\n\\n- Added note related to the cabinet session.\\n\\n**11/05/23 17:00**\\n\\n- Added details to deployment process\\n\\n**10/31/23 22:05**\\n\\n- Removed \\"Needs based assestment\\" from ResilientNet segment.\\n- Updated allocations table."},{"id":"mediaguard_continuity_plan","metadata":{"permalink":"/ar/messages/mediaguard_continuity_plan","source":"@site/messages/2023-10-18-mediaguard-lebanonconflcit23.md","title":"MediaGuard Continuity Plan for Lebanon Conflict","description":"P Foundation is redoubling its efforts through MediaGuard program, which has been steadfastly supporting journalists and media organizations for the past 18 months\u2014all at no cost.","date":"2023-10-18T13:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.835,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jud Saoud","title":"COO of P Foundation","email":"jud@p.foundation","imageURL":"https://github.com/judsd.png","key":"jud"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"MediaGuard Continuity Plan for Lebanon Conflict","description":"P Foundation is redoubling its efforts through MediaGuard program, which has been steadfastly supporting journalists and media organizations for the past 18 months\u2014all at no cost.","slug":"mediaguard_continuity_plan","authors":"jud","hide_table_of_contents":false,"date":"2023-10-18T13:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1730219412000,"prevItem":{"title":"Lebanon Crisis Response Plan","permalink":"/ar/messages/lebanon_crisis_response_plan"}},"content":"Given the recent escalaction in Gaza, we perceive an escalating risk of military conflict between Israel and Lebanon.\\n\\nWe\'re concerned that many media outlets, despite having business continuity plans, may be underestimating the scale of a potential conflict.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn response, we are redoubling our efforts through our [MediaGuard](/programs) program, which has been steadfastly supporting journalists and media organizations for the past 18 months\u2014all at no cost.\\n\\nThe [MediaGuard](/programs) program exemplifies our commitment to fortifying media organizations worldwide by offering a range of customized, free-of-charge services such as backhaul support, downlinking, digital streaming, and content distribution.\\n\\nCentral to MediaGuard\'s mission is aiding media organizations in achieving and maintaining operational stability. Consequently, P Foundation is extending various specialized services through MediaGuard in the event of conflict, also free of charge.\\n\\n## For TV Broadcasters\\n\\n### Backbone and Playout Support\\n\\nAlthough an internet blackout may not occur immediately, we anticipate that it could become a reality if the conflict lasts longer than 30 days.\\n\\nWhile most tv broadcaster in Lebanon use IP for their backhaul, we believe they all also maintain a satellite backup. We urge all broadcasters to ensure that their satellite backup is operational.\\n\\nIn addition to the satellite backup, we have expanded our computing capacities in both London and New York which would allow us to allocate enough resources for all broadcasters to maintain a backup playout in case of emergency. We recommend that you upload backup content from now instead of waiting for last minute. Please communicate your requirements to your contact point, and we will allocate the necessary resources.\\n\\nOur infrastructure includes Zixi encoders in both locations and we maintains an open channel with Arabsat NOC, enabling broadcasters to switch to a backup within minutes of any outage.\\n\\n### Live Streaming\\n\\nLive broadcasts are crucial news sources during conflicts.\\n\\nWe strongly recommend that media organizations shift their digital streaming to utilize offshore facilities. If you don\'t have one ready, our Spain-based facilities can downlink most beams from Arabsat and Nilesat, and we are able to allocate resources for you to stream from there. Please reach out to your contact point at PF to arrange.\\n\\nWe are also enabling our MediaGuard dashboard for all broadcasters to downlink their feeds and restream them to their content distribution partners and social platforms.\\n\\nWith an anticipated surge in online viewership, we advise broadcasters to expand their live streaming to additional platforms like YouTube, Rumble, and X.\\n\\nFor those experiencing growing viewership on their proprietary platforms and unable to switch to others, we\'ve partnere with multiple CDNs and we are able to increase the free content distribution limit from 100TB a month to 1PB.\\n\\n## For Broadcasters, Print and Online Media\\n\\n### Increased attacks\\n\\nIt is typical for any military conflict to extend to the cyberspace, and this was [evident](https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-israel-and-palestine-following-the-october-2023-attacks/) in Gaza and Israel past few days. We expect the same to happen in Lebanon.\\n\\nAlong with traditional DDOS attack, we expect an increase in phishing attacks on journalists and media organizations. We urge all media organizations to be extra vigilant and send a reminder to all staff to be extra cautious when opening emails and clicking on links, specially their digital teams.\\n\\nWhile most organisations already use Cloudflare, we believe some have had security gaps that left their origins exposed and vulnerable to attacks. If you are not sure about your security setup, please reach out to your contact point at PF and we will help you assess your setup and make the necessary changes.\\n\\nWe recommend that you increase your replication resources or maintain hourly backups. If your provider support ransom protection, that we definitely recommend that you enable it.\\n\\nIn addition, we have increased our capacity in DC, and we are able to accomodate most media platforms. If you think that you are likely to be targeted and you prefer to move your website to our isolated infrastructure, please reach out to your contact points at PF and we will help you with the migration.\\n\\n### Shared Working Space\\n\\nWe recognize that not all media organizations have their own facilities or contingency plans. To address this, we\'ve set up a 300-square-meter shared working space in a designated \\"safe area.\\"\\n\\nDesigned to accommodate 35-40 people at a time, the space has sufficient diesel reserves to offer continuous power for up to 45 days. It also features multiple backhauls to ensure a stable internet connection.\\n\\nThough the facility is open to all journalists, we request that you contact us via Discord or email (mediaguard@p.foundation) and include copies of IDs or Passports for those planning to use the facility."}]}')}}]);
