We are unwaveringly committed to fostering progress and uplifting the communities we serve. Central to our mission is the philosophy that an open internet and unrestricted journalism serve as the lifeblood of progressive societies, weaving together the essential elements of transparency, accountability, and unfettered expression.\\n\\n## Situation Overview\\n\\nIn the wake of escalating tensions and recent events in Gaza, we are increasingly concerned about the high likelihood of a military conflict erupting between Israel and Lebanon.\\n\\n## Infrastructure Concerns\\n\\nPossessing an in-depth understanding of Lebanon\'s Internet Infrastructure, we project that even without targeted attacks on vital internet nodes and in the absence of a national diesel reserve, most local exchange points are at risk of depleting their diesel reserves. Should this occur, a widespread internet blackout across Lebanon would be inevitable within one to two weeks.\\n\\n## Our Initiative\\n\\nWhile we have successfully secured funds for our Media Guard Emergency Plan, we are actively seeking immediate donors to contribute to our Community Mesh Program.\\n\\n## Importance of Communication\\n\\nGiven the displacement of populations and the extreme stress associated with wartime conditions, maintaining communication lines and internet access will become indispensable for residents to stay connected both within and beyond the country\'s borders.\\n\\n## Program Expansion\\n\\nAs we await the final authorizations to deploy temporary satellite internet access, we aim to broaden the reach of our Community Mesh Program by integrating an additional 150 communities.\\n\\n## Technical Specifications\\n\\nEach community will be equipped with a compact satellite dish for internet access and a Wi-Fi access point capable of supporting up to 300 devices simultaneously. The system is powered by solar panels and supplemented with a small battery, enabling limited nighttime usage.\\n\\n## Operational Management\\n\\nDepending on the location, the management and upkeep of the mesh will be delegated either to the local municipality or a partnering non-profit organization. Volunteers will be stationed to ensure stable access and offer any required guidance to the public.\\n\\n## Geographical Distribution\\n\\nWe intend to deploy these mesh networks in densely populated regions like Beirut, Mount Lebanon, and North Lebanon, based on multiple criteria. The public will be informed of the mesh locations via our website or through a dedicated local phone number.\\n\\n## Capacity Limitations\\n\\nShould the demand surpass our current capabilities, we plan to rotate the mesh networks among various locations, thus maximizing the number of people who can gain internet access.\\n\\n## Post-Conflict Utility\\n\\nOnce the local infrastructure begins to recover post-conflict, these mesh networks can be reallocated to areas still experiencing service interruptions. Ultimately, these devices will be repurposed to augment our ongoing Community Mesh Program, providing internet access to schools and other public institutions in need.\\n\\n## Urgent Call to Action\\n\\nWe are racing against time; the most pressing challenge is to acquire the necessary equipment and transport it to Lebanon before a conflict commences and potential airport closures occur. While we have managed to make the requisite down payments for the satellite dishes, we are urgently seeking $350,000 to finalize implementation and sustain 90 days of service."}]}')}}]);
