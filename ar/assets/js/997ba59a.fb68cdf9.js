In practice, this means if Network A is peering with Network B at OpenIX, A should only send traffic to B for prefixes B (or B\u2019s customers) have announced at OpenIX. A should not forward traffic from B to some other non-connected network C via the exchange. Similarly, using the exchange to carry traffic between two of your own sites (as a backhaul) is not permitted unless explicitly arranged as a private service with OpenIX (see Private Interconnects under Services).
