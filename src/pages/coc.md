# Code of Conduct

At P Foundation, we are dedicated to bridging the digital divide and empowering communities through open internet access and free journalism. Guided by our core values of Patriotism, Passion, Persistence, and Partnership, we strive to create a culture of respect, integrity, and collaboration. This Code of Conduct applies to everyone involved with P Foundation—employees, volunteers, members, and partners—in all our activities and communications, both online and offline. By following these principles, we ensure a safe, inclusive, and professional environment that reflects our mission and values.

- **Respect and Inclusion:** Treat everyone with courtesy and empathy. We foster an inclusive community that welcomes diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or hateful behavior. We honor the cultures and communities we serve, ensuring all voices are valued and heard.

- **Integrity and Transparency:** Act with honesty and integrity in all dealings. Communicate openly and truthfully, and uphold the highest ethical standards. We hold ourselves accountable for our actions and embrace transparency in our work. Misrepresentation, dishonesty, or misuse of the foundation’s resources have no place in our efforts.

- **Open Communication and Free Expression:** Encourage the free exchange of ideas and information in line with our commitment to open internet and independent journalism. We support uninhibited expression and open dialogue, but we do so responsibly and respectfully. Constructive discourse is expected at all times—abuse, intimidation, deliberate censorship of others’ viewpoints, or spreading misinformation contradict our mission and will not be accepted.

- **Collaboration and Partnership:** Work together in a spirit of teamwork and partnership. Our impact is amplified through cooperation, so we value the contributions of every team member and partner. Be supportive, share knowledge, and help others succeed. We build alliances on trust and mutual respect, resolve disagreements constructively, and seek common ground to further our shared goals.

- **Accountability and Professionalism:** Uphold professionalism in all activities, whether in person or online. Follow applicable laws and organizational guidelines, and respect the policies of our foundation and partners. Take responsibility for your words and actions. If mistakes occur, acknowledge and correct them. Each of us represents P Foundation, so we conduct ourselves in a manner that preserves the organization’s credibility, safety, and focus on the public good.

- **Commitment to Our Mission:** Always keep P Foundation’s purpose at the forefront. Ensure that your decisions and behavior align with our mission of advancing open access to information and supporting free, independent media. Avoid any actions that would undermine this mission or erode the trust of the communities we serve. Through our shared patriotism and passion for positive change, we remain steadfast in pursuing our goals for a brighter, more informed, and interconnected world.

By adhering to this Code of Conduct, we create a respectful and supportive environment where everyone can contribute to P Foundation’s vision. Thank you for embodying these principles and helping to advance our shared mission.
