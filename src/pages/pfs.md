# PFS LTD

PFS LTD functions as the commercial partner for the P Foundation, extending its reach into more advanced service offerings.

While the P Foundation provides essential foundational support at no cost, PFS LTD enhances this by offering a broader spectrum of support services. These include comprehensive network communication solutions such as advanced interconnectivity, internet access, and various managed services, thereby enriching and extending beyond the basic services supported by the P Foundation programs.

Notably, all profits generated by PFS LTD are donated to the Foundation, supporting the growth and expansion of its programs and overall impact.
