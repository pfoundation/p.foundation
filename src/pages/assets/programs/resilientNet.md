ResilientNet is a specialized extension of our existing Citizen Mesh program, aimed at providing robust internet connectivity to critical installations essential for public well-being. Originating from the grassroots success of Citizen Mesh, this initiative targets facilities that are often overlooked by governmental support, including healthcare institutions, emergency services, and utility facilities. By leveraging state-of-the-art technology and community involvement, ResilientNet is committed to building a dependable and self-sustaining network infrastructure.

At the heart of the program is a meticulous, needs-based assessment methodology, designed to identify the unique connectivity requirements of each targeted critical installation. Customized networking solutions are then developed and deployed, covering aspects from network design to hardware selection and installation. A cadre of skilled volunteers executes these operations, ensuring seamless and resilient connectivity.

ResilientNet maintains an open stance toward collaboration and actively seeks contributions and partnerships with external stakeholders, including local businesses and tech organizations.
