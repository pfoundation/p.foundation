The P Foundation profoundly understands the transformative power of connectivity. In a world where we are at our best when linked—to educational institutions, job opportunities, and each other—the Internet serves as the vital backbone enabling these connections. Yet, we recognize that not all communities enjoy equal access to this powerful tool, hindering their ability to increase awareness and make informed decisions.

Our Citizen Mesh program is born from the belief that community-led solutions can fill these gaps. Whether it's a remote village or a bustling city, our initiative empowers communities to build and maintain their own reliable internet connections. We focus on key communal spaces such as educational institutions, public libraries, and public spaces, offering free internet access as a cornerstone for enhancing public life. This approach is founded on the principle of the Internet being by the people, for the people, ensuring that all have the opportunity to connect and thrive.

Our dedicated volunteers employ a systematic yet straightforward approach to assess the needs for internet connectivity in various communities and diligently work to expand our services.
We warmly welcome and encourage contributions from external stakeholders and the community at large.

Suggestions, insights, and applications from institutions that meet our criteria can be submitted to cmp@p.foundation.
