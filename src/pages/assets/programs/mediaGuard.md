We firmly believe in the power and significance of open access to media and a free press. Recognizing their pivotal role in the success and development of nations and communities, we proudly present the "Media Guard" program.

It's our way of walking beside media organizations from all around the world, offering a helping hand so they can maintain a steady presence.

Designed to bolster media organizations globally, Media Guard extends tailored support, ensuring they maintain a consistent and uninterrupted media presence.

Depending on the specific needs of each organization, our aid encompasses a variety of services including backhaul support, downlinking, digital streaming, and content distribution.

The program is available for media organizations around the world. Organizations interested in taking part in our program can apply at mediaguard@p.foundation.
