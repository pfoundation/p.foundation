I&nbsp;write back-end applications in **Go** and modern front-ends using **TypeScript** (**React.js**). I design and implement **GraphQL**, **gRPC** and **REST** APIs.

I&nbsp;work in a cloud-native environment in the "you build it, you run it" model. Apart from building microservices, I use and extend **Kubernetes**. I am both [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/4ef650a8-2c5d-48df-bdc7-d7bafdd9e4ec) and [Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/32059797-c35c-4c49-bcc3-d27268a530df).

In 2018, I&nbsp;have completed a&nbsp;master's in Computer Science at Silesian University of Technology.

I'm open source and cloud-native enthusiast. That's why I'm a&nbsp;co-organizer of the&nbsp;[Gophers Silesia](https://www.meetup.com/GophersSilesia) meetup, which is a&nbsp;local community interested in Go & cloud-native topics.
