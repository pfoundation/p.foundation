title: Eligibility and Requirements
description: The criteria and requirements for networks to join OpenIX, including technical, operational, and legal prerequisites.
---

OpenIX welcomes any qualified network operator to join the exchange, subject to meeting the following eligibility criteria:

- **Autonomous System Number (ASN):** Participants must operate a unique, publicly routable ASN. The ASN should be assigned by a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) and not be an ASN used exclusively for private networks.
- **IP Address Space:** Participants should own or legitimately hold publicly routable IP address space (IPv4 and/or IPv6 prefixes) that they intend to announce at the exchange. The IP prefixes should be registered in appropriate databases (RIR or IRR records) to facilitate route filtering and validation.
- **Network Capability:** Participants must be capable of running BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for peering. They should have the technical ability to configure BGP sessions with other networks and optionally with the route servers provided by OpenIX. A competent network engineer or team should be available to manage the BGP peering sessions and respond to routing issues.
- **24×7 NOC Contact:** Each participant is required to provide up-to-date contact information for a Network Operations Center (NOC) or responsible technical personnel who are available 24x7. This contact will be used by OpenIX staff or other participants to report and resolve operational issues (such as routing leaks, security incidents, or connectivity problems).
- **PeeringDB Entry:** Participants are strongly encouraged to maintain an entry in the PeeringDB database with accurate details of their network (ASN, peering policy, NOC contacts, etc.). A PeeringDB record is considered an industry best practice and helps facilitate peering negotiations. OpenIX may use PeeringDB information as part of the onboarding review.
- **Licensing and Legal Compliance:** Participants must be in compliance with any Lebanese licensing requirements for telecommunications or internet service provision. For example, ISPs or telecom carriers connecting to the IX should possess the appropriate licenses from the Lebanese authorities. International or content networks connecting must likewise ensure their participation does not violate any local laws. Participants are solely responsible for adhering to all applicable laws and regulations in their operations.
- **Agreement to Policies:** All participants must agree to the OpenIX policies (this document) and any applicable terms of service or contractual agreement. Participants will sign a service agreement or acknowledgment that they will abide by these policies. Failure to comply can result in suspension or termination of service.
- **Equipment and Technical Readiness:** Participants must have the necessary equipment (router, transceivers, cables) to connect via single-mode fiber at the supported port speeds of the exchange. Their equipment should be configured to meet OpenIX technical standards (e.g., MTU settings, no prohibited protocols, etc. – see Technical Standards section). They should also ensure their routers have adequate capacity and filtering to handle peering traffic and protect the exchange from any misconfigurations (e.g., apply max prefix limits, etc.).

OpenIX reserves the right to approve or reject a participation request based on these criteria. If an applicant does not meet the requirements (for instance, lacks an ASN or is not a bona fide network operator), OpenIX will inform them and may assist by explaining what steps to take (such as obtaining an ASN or setting up a PeeringDB entry) before re-applying. The goal is to maintain a community of legitimate network operators on the exchange for the benefit of all participants.
