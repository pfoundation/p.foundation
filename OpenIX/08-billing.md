title: Billing and Fees
description: The fee structure, billing practices, and payment terms for participants connecting to OpenIX, including port fees and additional services.
---

OpenIX operates on a for-profit, commercial basis. Participants are required to pay service fees for the ports and services they utilize. This section explains the billing practices and fee structure in general terms (specific pricing details are provided separately in the OpenIX pricing schedule and in each participant’s contract/proposal):

## Port Fees

A standard **port fee** is charged for each port (physical interface) a participant has on the exchange. Fees may vary by port speed – for example, a 1 Gbps port will have a lower monthly fee than a 10 Gbps or 100 Gbps port, reflecting the greater capacity and resources of higher speeds. Port fees cover the right to use the exchange fabric, the route servers, and basic support. The fee is typically recurring (billed monthly, quarterly, or annually as per the agreement). OpenIX may offer discounts for longer-term commitments (e.g., paying annually in advance) or for volume (e.g., if a participant has multiple ports or connects in multiple cities in the future). The current fee schedule can be obtained from OpenIX sales or website.

## Installation and Setup Charges

There may be a one-time installation or setup fee for new connections. This covers the labor and configuration tasks of provisioning a port, testing, and documentation. If a participant requires a new cross-connect within the facility, the data center operator might charge a separate cross-connect fee directly to the participant (outside of OpenIX’s charges). OpenIX will coordinate the technical setup but any such third-party costs (e.g., cross-connect fees, MoT NTS circuit fees) are generally the responsibility of the participant. OpenIX’s own setup fee, if applicable, will be invoiced on the first bill. We strive to keep installation fees reasonable and competitive.

## Service Fees for Additional Services

If a participant subscribes to additional OpenIX services beyond the basic port/public peering (for example, a private VLAN interconnect, a cloud connect service, remote peering via a partner, etc.), those services may incur extra monthly fees. Each such service will be quoted individually. For instance, a private interconnect VLAN between two ports might have a flat monthly charge per VLAN. Cloud connectivity might be charged based on bandwidth or a fixed port fee if a separate port is provided for cloud access. All these details will be transparently provided and agreed upon before provisioning. There are no hidden charges – OpenIX will document any non-standard service charges in the service order.

## Billing Cycle

By default, OpenIX bills services **monthly**. Invoices are typically issued at the start of each month (or on the anniversary of service commencement) and include charges for that month’s service in advance, plus any variable or one-time charges from the previous period if applicable. For example, a January 1 invoice might cover the port fee for January 1–31, plus any setup fee or any overage/late fees from prior period. Some customers may opt for quarterly or annual billing – OpenIX can accommodate different billing cycles on request, especially for international participants or those who prefer fewer invoices.

## Payment Terms

Invoices are due within a specified term, usually **30 days** from the invoice date, unless otherwise agreed. The acceptable payment methods (bank transfer, check, etc.) will be indicated on the invoice or in the contract. Payments must be made in the currency specified (OpenIX may price services in USD or Lebanese Pounds or another stable currency; given Lebanon’s context, USD or equivalent may be preferred for stability). Participants are responsible for any bank fees on their side; OpenIX should receive the full net amount.

## Taxes and Regulatory Fees

All fees are typically quoted **exclusive of any taxes**. If any Value Added Tax (VAT) or similar taxes are applicable under Lebanese law, those will be added to the invoices as a separate line item. Participants are responsible for paying any such taxes. If a participant is tax-exempt or has special status, they must provide the necessary documentation in advance. Additionally, if in the future any regulatory cost recovery fees or contributions (for example, sector development fund contributions mandated by government) apply to IX services, OpenIX will pass those through as needed with notice.

## Late Payment and Non-Payment

Timely payment is critical to maintain service. If an invoice is not paid by the due date, OpenIX will send a reminder. Generally, we provide a short grace period (e.g., 10-15 days after due date) before taking action. Past that, the following may apply: a **late fee** or interest may accrue on overdue balances (for instance, 1.5% per month or a flat fee for administrative handling). If an invoice remains unpaid for an extended period (e.g., over 30 days past due) and the participant has not made arrangements, OpenIX reserves the right to suspend the participant’s port (temporarily disabling peering) until payment is received. We will provide warning notices (via email/phone to the provided contacts) prior to any suspension. Ultimately, continued non-payment is grounds for termination of service (see Termination section). We understand sometimes there are billing disputes or delays – participants are encouraged to communicate with OpenIX’s billing department if there’s any issue processing payment so that we can find a solution or provide an extension if warranted. Good communication can prevent unnecessary downtime.

## Currency and Exchange Rates

Given the fluctuations in local currency, OpenIX may denominate contracts in a stable currency (e.g., USD or EUR) to ensure the value of service is maintained. If payments are allowed in local currency, the exchange rate (from USD to LBP, for example) may be determined by the market rate at time of billing or a rate specified in the contract. This will be clearly defined in the service agreement. Participants should be aware of currency considerations and budget accordingly.

## Refunds

In general, recurring service fees are not refundable once paid, except in the case of service termination with a prepaid term or an SLA credit situation. For instance, if a participant paid annually and decides (or is forced) to terminate early, refunds for the unused portion will be handled as per the contract (some contracts might state no refund for early termination or might allow pro-rated refund in certain cases). SLA credits or service credits, when granted, are usually applied to future invoices rather than cash payout. OpenIX will abide by the contractual terms regarding any refunds or credits due.

## Changes in Service or Upgrades

If a participant upgrades their port (say from 1G to 10G) or adds a service mid-month, the billing for the new service will be pro-rated from the date of change. Similarly, if they cease a service mid-cycle (with OpenIX’s agreement), we will pro-rate to the termination date. Our billing system is flexible to account for such changes. Any new quotes or orders will clearly show the effect on recurring fees. If OpenIX changes its pricing (for example, a general price adjustment due to market conditions or offering new speeds), existing participants will be given advance notice and grandfathering options as appropriate. Typically, contract prices are fixed for the term of the contract, and adjustments apply upon renewal or new orders.

OpenIX’s goal is to have a fair and sustainable fee structure that allows us to operate and improve the exchange while remaining affordable for participants. We aim for transparency in billing – no surprise charges, and clear communication of costs. Participants are encouraged to reach out if they have any questions about their bill or if they need custom arrangements (for example, a tailored billing cycle or combined billing for multiple ports, etc.). We consider our participants as valued customers and will work to accommodate reasonable requests in the billing process.
