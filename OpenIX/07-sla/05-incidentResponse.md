OpenIX provides **24/7 network monitoring and support**. If an unplanned outage or incident occurs (like a power failure, a fiber cut, a DDoS affecting the fabric, etc.), OpenIXâ€™s NOC will respond immediately. Participants can report issues at any time via the provided emergency contact channels.

OpenIX will update participants periodically during a major incident and will send a post-incident report if appropriate, explaining the cause and resolution. We aim for rapid restoration: for critical failures (e.g., core switch down), our target is to restore service within **30 minutes** to **1 hour** if possible, or at least implement a workaround (like moving everyone to a backup switch).
