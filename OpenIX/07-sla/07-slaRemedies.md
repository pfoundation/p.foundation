description: Credit and compensation policies for SLA breaches, including the process for reporting outages and claiming service credits.

While OpenIX is confident in its uptime, if we fail to meet the guaranteed SLA (for example, a prolonged outage occurs that is within OpenIXâ€™s control and not due to participant error or external factors like MoT fiber cuts), participants may be entitled to service credits or other remedies as defined in their contract.

Typically, the SLA might specify that for each hour of outage beyond the guaranteed limit, a certain percentage of the monthly port fee is credited. OpenIX will handle such situations on a case-by-case basis in alignment with the contract terms, and our policy is to be fair and transparent about outages.

If an outage was caused by force majeure events (natural disasters, etc.) or issues outside OpenIX control, we will still do our best to mitigate but those may be exempt from credit. ll participants will be informed of their recourse in the rare event of a service level breach.
