description: OpenIX's scheduled maintenance policy, including advance notice periods, off-peak scheduling, and communication practices for planned work.
---

To maintain the high performance and up-to-date equipment, OpenIX will occasionally need to conduct maintenance (such as software upgrades on switches or route servers, replacing hardware, etc.).

Scheduled maintenance windows will be announced to all participants at least **7 days in advance** (and usually earlier for major work).

Maintenance will be planned during off-peak hours (often late night or early morning local time) to minimize impact on participants.

During maintenance, OpenIX will endeavor to keep the exchange online (for instance, doing hitless upgrades or one switch at a time if redundant) but if an outage is expected, that will be clearly communicated with the expected duration.

Participants are responsible for ensuring they have read these notices and prepared their networks if necessary (e.g., having backup routes via transit during a maintenance window in case of interruptions).
