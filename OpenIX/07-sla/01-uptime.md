description: OpenIX's 99.99% uptime target, explaining the redundancy and engineering measures in place to ensure continuous service availability.
---

OpenIX targets an availability of **99.99% or higher** for the core exchange infrastructure. This means the switching platform and related critical systems (like route servers and power to the equipment) are expected to be operational virtually all the time, with very minimal downtime. 99.99% uptime equates to roughly less than 1 hour of downtime per year.

OpenIX has built redundancy and robust engineering into the platform to achieve this level of reliability (for example, redundant power supplies, UPS and backup generators in the facility, redundant route servers, etc.).

In the event that a hardware failure occurs (e.g., a switch line card or transceiver failure), OpenIX aims to repair or replace it as quickly as possible, often with automatic failover if redundant components are in place.
