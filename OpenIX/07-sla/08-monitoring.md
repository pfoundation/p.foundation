OpenIX continuously monitors port statuses, link errors, CPU/memory of equipment, and overall traffic flows. We use this data to proactively detect issues (for example, if a port shows a high error count, we may reach out to the participant to check the fiber or optic).

We also measure utilization to plan upgrades (ensuring the backbone or any inter-switch link is always sufficiently over-provisioned). Part of our SLA commitment is proactive action â€“ fixing issues before they become failures. Participants can trust that the exchange is under vigilant watch.
