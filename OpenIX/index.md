title: EdgeIX Beirut Internet Exchange Policy
---

## Introduction

EdgeIX Beirut Internet Exchange (EdgeIX Beirut) is a neutral, carrier-neutral and data center-neutral interconnection platform that enables networks to efficiently exchange internet traffic in Lebanon. Unlike a member-governed cooperative model, EdgeIX Beirut is a privately owned, for-profit IX operated by a professional management team. This model is similar to leading global exchanges (e.g., Equinix Internet Exchange), providing a high-quality peering environment on equal terms to all qualifying participants while EdgeIX retains full operational and strategic control. The following policy outlines the terms, conditions, and standards for connecting to and using EdgeIX Beirut. All participants must adhere to these policies to maintain a secure, efficient, and fair peering environment. EdgeIX Beirut is committed to international best practices and operates in compliance with Lebanese regulatory requirements.

## Governance and Organizational Structure

EdgeIX Beirut is owned and operated by EdgeIX (a private entity).

EdgeIX Beirut maintains a **neutral governance stance** – it is not affiliated with any single service provider, carrier, or data center. Neutrality is assured by offering the same terms and services to all participants without discrimination. The EdgeIX team may seek input from the peering community informally, but participants do not have formal governance roles or decision-making power in the IX’s operations. All policy changes or service modifications are decided by EdgeIX management, who will communicate updates to participants in a timely manner.

EdgeIX Beirut operates under Lebanese law and any applicable telecommunications regulations. Where required, EdgeIX obtains and maintains any licenses or approvals needed to run a commercial Internet Exchange. The organization works to ensure compliance with the Ministry of Telecommunications (MoT) guidelines and any regulatory directives, while also aligning with global best practices for IXPs. In all governance matters, EdgeIX’s priority is to provide a stable, efficient, and open interconnection environment for the benefit of the internet ecosystem in Lebanon and the region.

## Eligibility and Participant Requirements

EdgeIX Beirut welcomes any qualified network operator to join the exchange, subject to meeting the following eligibility criteria:

- **Autonomous System Number (ASN):** Participants must operate a unique, publicly routable ASN. The ASN should be assigned by a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) and not be an ASN used exclusively for private networks.
- **IP Address Space:** Participants should own or legitimately hold publicly routable IP address space (IPv4 and/or IPv6 prefixes) that they intend to announce at the exchange. The IP prefixes should be registered in appropriate databases (RIR or IRR records) to facilitate route filtering and validation.
- **Network Capability:** Participants must be capable of running BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for peering. They should have the technical ability to configure BGP sessions with other networks and optionally with the route servers provided by EdgeIX. A competent network engineer or team should be available to manage the BGP peering sessions and respond to routing issues.
- **24×7 NOC Contact:** Each participant is required to provide up-to-date contact information for a Network Operations Center (NOC) or responsible technical personnel who are available 24x7. This contact will be used by EdgeIX staff or other participants to report and resolve operational issues (such as routing leaks, security incidents, or connectivity problems).
- **PeeringDB Entry:** Participants are strongly encouraged to maintain an entry in the PeeringDB database with accurate details of their network (ASN, peering policy, NOC contacts, etc.). A PeeringDB record is considered an industry best practice and helps facilitate peering negotiations. EdgeIX may use PeeringDB information as part of the onboarding review.
- **Licensing and Legal Compliance:** Participants must be in compliance with any Lebanese licensing requirements for telecommunications or internet service provision. For example, ISPs or telecom carriers connecting to the IX should possess the appropriate licenses from the Lebanese authorities. International or content networks connecting must likewise ensure their participation does not violate any local laws. Participants are solely responsible for adhering to all applicable laws and regulations in their operations.
- **Agreement to Policies:** All participants must agree to the EdgeIX Beirut policies (this document) and any applicable terms of service or contractual agreement. Participants will sign a service agreement or acknowledgment that they will abide by these policies. Failure to comply can result in suspension or termination of service.
- **Equipment and Technical Readiness:** Participants must have the necessary equipment (router, transceivers, cables) to connect via single-mode fiber at the supported port speeds of the exchange. Their equipment should be configured to meet EdgeIX technical standards (e.g., MTU settings, no prohibited protocols, etc. – see Technical Standards section). They should also ensure their routers have adequate capacity and filtering to handle peering traffic and protect the exchange from any misconfigurations (e.g., apply max prefix limits, etc.).

EdgeIX Beirut reserves the right to approve or reject a participation request based on these criteria. If an applicant does not meet the requirements (for instance, lacks an ASN or is not a bona fide network operator), EdgeIX will inform them and may assist by explaining what steps to take (such as obtaining an ASN or setting up a PeeringDB entry) before re-applying. The goal is to maintain a community of legitimate network operators on the exchange for the benefit of all participants.

## Technical Standards and Infrastructure Requirements

EdgeIX Beirut operates a high-performance Ethernet switching fabric to which all participants connect. To ensure reliability and interoperability, the following technical standards and requirements apply to all connections:

- **Physical Connection Medium:** **Only single-mode fiber** is accepted for all connections to EdgeIX. This applies to both intra-facility cross-connects and any external circuit connections. Copper-based Ethernet (e.g., RJ45 Cat6/Cat5 cables) is **not permitted** for any port speed, including 1 Gbps. Participants must use single-mode optical fiber with the appropriate transceivers for their port (e.g., 1G SX/LX fiber transceiver, 10G SFP+ LR, 100G LR4/CSR4, etc. as supported by the exchange). This requirement ensures signal integrity, supports longer distances, and maintains the professional standard of the platform.
- **Port Speeds and Interface Types:** EdgeIX Beirut offers ports at standard speeds such as 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 100 Gbps (higher speeds like 400 Gbps may be offered in the future as technology and demand progress). All port types use optical interfaces (single-mode fiber as noted). Participants should specify the desired port capacity when applying, and EdgeIX will provision the connection on the switching fabric accordingly. If a participant requires multiple ports aggregated for higher throughput or redundancy, Link Aggregation (LAG) can be arranged, subject to EdgeIX’s technical approval. LAG groups must still conform to the one MAC address rule (see below) across the bundle.
- **MAC Address and Device Requirements:** Each participant port (or LAG bundle) is restricted to a single unique MAC address visible on the exchange fabric. Participants should connect a single routing device to each port (or port bundle) and not bridge multiple devices or networks behind one port. EdgeIX enforces Layer2 MAC filtering to block frames from unauthorized MAC addresses. If a participant needs to connect multiple routers or networks, they must obtain additional ports or coordinate with EdgeIX for an approved configuration. This policy prevents loops and ensures accountability for traffic sources on the exchange.
- **Allowed Protocols (Layer-2 and Layer-3):** The exchange fabric is an Ethernet switching environment carrying primarily IP traffic. Only the following EtherTypes and protocols are allowed across the EdgeIX Beirut switch:

  - **0x0800 – IPv4** (Internet Protocol v4 traffic)
  - **0x86DD – IPv6** (Internet Protocol v6 traffic)
  - **0x0806 – ARP** (Address Resolution Protocol for IPv4) and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages (ICMPv6 types for ND).
    No other Layer-2 protocols or non-IP traffic shall be forwarded. In particular, **Link-local or control protocols** such as Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Rapid STP, Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), LLDP, etc., are **not allowed** on the peering fabric and should be disabled on the participant’s interface towards EdgeIX. EdgeIX will filter or drop common disallowed Ethernet frames (e.g., BPDU frames, LACP, etc.) to protect the platform. Similarly, **Proxy ARP** or any attempt to act as an ARP proxy on the exchange is forbidden – participants should only respond to ARP for their own IPs.

- **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):** EdgeIX supports a standard MTU of 1500 bytes for Ethernet frames by default. The exchange also **supports jumbo frames**, up to an MTU of 9000 bytes, to facilitate efficient transfer of large packets if participants mutually agree to use jumbo frames. Participants must ensure their interface MTU is configured appropriately. All devices should handle at least 1500-byte frames; using jumbo frames is optional but recommended for better efficiency and must be consistently configured by any two peers that want to exchange jumbo traffic. The route servers (if used) are typically configured for jumbo frames as well.
- **IP Addressing on the Exchange:** EdgeIX will assign each participant an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address from the exchange’s peering LAN subnets for use on their interface. These addresses are used for BGP peering between participants. Participants must configure only the IPs assigned to them on the exchange interface. The exchange LAN IPs should **not** be advertised to the global internet or outside of the IXP. They are intended solely for exchange-related communication (e.g., BGP sessions, ARP/ND, and limited operations like ping for monitoring). If a participant uses the route servers, they will peer with them using these IPs. Participants should use router-loopback IPs only on their side for their iBGP, etc., but **not** on the exchange link.
- **Route Servers:** EdgeIX Beirut provides one or more route servers as a service to facilitate multilateral peering (see Peering Policy section for details). From a technical standpoint, route server sessions are done via BGP. Participants who choose to peer with the route servers must configure BGP sessions (one to each route server, typically two for redundancy) using the provided IPs and ASN of the route server. The route servers will **not** forward traffic; they only exchange routes. Participants should ensure they implement proper BGP import/export policies even when using route servers (e.g., honoring BGP communities for route control, if supported, and implementing max prefix limits to protect against route leaks). EdgeIX’s route servers enforce filtering (using IRR data and route validation) and limit the prefixes a participant can announce by default to ensure stability. Technical details for route server usage (such as the ASN, IPs, and supported BGP community controls) are provided in the EdgeIX technical guide or upon request.
- **Traffic Limits and Quality:** EdgeIX does not impose artificial traffic rate limits on ports (aside from the physical port speed). Participants are expected to manage their own capacity; if a port is frequently congested, the participant should consider upgrading to a higher speed or adding ports via LAG. The exchange fabric is designed for non-blocking performance at line rate on all ports. Packet forwarding is at Layer 2, and EdgeIX monitors for excessive broadcasts or unknown unicast flooding. Broadcast traffic should be limited to essential ARP/ND only. Unknown destination traffic will be broadcast/flooded by the switch as per normal Ethernet behavior, but EdgeIX employs controls (like MAC filtering and possibly storm control) to minimize any such traffic. Participants must not flood the exchange with continuous high-rate broadcasts/multicasts as it can degrade performance for others (this would be a violation of the AUP).
- **Clock and Synchronization:** If participants use protocols like NTP over the exchange or run services that rely on timing, note that the exchange does not provide any synchronization services – it only passes traffic. Participants should ensure their equipment’s clocks are synchronized via their own methods (GPS, internet NTP, etc.) if needed. There is no impact on exchange operations; this is just a note that EdgeIX is a Layer-2 facility and does not handle any timing protocols such as PTP (IEEE 1588) on the peering LAN.
- **Equipment Standards:** Participant equipment connected to EdgeIX should be of carrier-grade quality to maintain overall reliability. It should support IPv4 and IPv6 routing in hardware or adequate software performance. The interface should be configured as an access/untagged port on the EdgeIX VLAN (EdgeIX will handle VLAN tagging on its side if needed; by default, all participants connect to a common untagged VLAN for public peering). Participants must disable any DHCP server or other endpoint services on the exchange interface to avoid interfering with others. Only routers or layer3 devices should be connected (no end-hosts or general-purpose servers should be directly connected to the exchange port, except if acting as routers or route servers under participant’s ASN).

EdgeIX engineering staff will work with each participant during the connection setup (installation) to ensure these technical requirements are met. Testing may be done (for example, verifying the correct MAC is seen, BGP sessions come up, no prohibited protocols are detected). EdgeIX reserves the right to delay or refuse a connection if the participant’s equipment or configuration does not conform to these standards, in order to protect the exchange and existing participants. Once connected, ongoing compliance with these technical rules is mandatory; violations (even if unintentional, like a misconfiguration enabling STP) will lead to intervention by EdgeIX (which may include temporarily disabling the port until the issue is resolved).

## Peering Policy

EdgeIX Beirut’s core purpose is to facilitate **peering** among networks. Peering is the mutual exchange of routing information and traffic between participants’ networks. EdgeIX itself does not involve itself in participants’ business arrangements (most peering at EdgeIX is settlement-free, but any commercial terms between networks are outside the scope of EdgeIX). However, to ensure an effective peering environment, the following policies apply:

- **BGP Sessions:** All traffic exchange between participants across the IX is predicated on BGP. Participants must establish BGP sessions with each other (bilaterally or via the route servers) to exchange routes. EdgeIX does not provide any transit or default routing – if there is no BGP route learned for a destination, traffic will not be exchanged. Participants are expected to only send traffic to destinations (prefixes) they have learned via BGP from that peer at the exchange. In other words, no static routes or proxy routing across the IX: the exchange is strictly for BGP-learned peering routes.
- **Multilateral Peering (Route Servers):** EdgeIX offers route server service to simplify peering for participants. By peering with the route servers, a network can exchange routes with many other route-server-connected participants through a single (or dual for redundancy) BGP session, rather than maintaining individual sessions with each peer. Use of the route servers is optional but encouraged, especially for new or smaller participants to quickly gain reachability with others. Participants can still establish direct bilateral BGP sessions with any other participant if they choose (for example, if they prefer not to use the route server for certain peers or in general). EdgeIX’s route servers implement prefix filtering (using IRR and RPKI data to allow only valid, registered routes) and do not propagate routes learned from one participant to another if those routes are filtered or if the participant is not authorized to advertise them. The route servers also support community controls – participants can tag routes with BGP communities to control which peers receive them (e.g., to opt-out of peering with specific ASNs or to limit route distribution). These community conventions will be documented and provided (they are similar to those used by other major IXPs).
- **Bilateral Peering:** Participants are free to negotiate bilateral peering sessions with each other outside of the route server. EdgeIX can provide assistance (such as listing all participant NOC contacts and PeeringDB info) but does not mandate any network to peer with any other – peering agreements are at the discretion of the participants. If a participant has a selective peering policy (e.g., only peers with certain types of networks or requires a certain traffic ratio), it is that participant’s responsibility to communicate and enforce it. EdgeIX itself will not enforce any bilateral peering requirements, aside from the expectation that participants should actively use the exchange for traffic exchange rather than remain idle.
- **Peering Etiquette:** All participants should follow industry best practices for peering. This includes:

  - Keeping contact information current so that other networks can reach out to request peering or address issues.
  - Responding to peering requests in a reasonable timeframe, even if the answer is a polite refusal (especially for networks with selective policies).
  - Advertising only their own routes or those of their customers (no route leaks of prefixes that are not authorized).
  - Accepting and honoring BGP prefix length constraints (for example, if the exchange has a maximum prefix length filter, e.g., no more specific than /24 for IPv4, /48 for IPv6 on the route servers, participants should abide by those when advertising).
  - Setting BGP **max-prefix** limits on all peering sessions to protect against accidental route flooding. EdgeIX may recommend specific max-prefix values (for example, slightly above the current total routes on the exchange) and will by default apply max-prefix limits on route server sessions for each participant to prevent full-table leaks.
  - Not pointing default routes or using the IX as a transit hub. Participants should not use a peer as a “default” route to reach the entire internet; each peering relation should be used only for the routes explicitly exchanged. Using the IX to transit traffic to third-party networks (that are not also participants and in mutual agreement) is against policy. In practice, this means if Network A is peering with Network B at EdgeIX, A should only send traffic to B for prefixes B (or B’s customers) have announced at EdgeIX. A should not forward traffic from B to some other non-connected network C via the exchange. Similarly, using the exchange to carry traffic between two of your own sites (as a backhaul) is not permitted unless explicitly arranged as a private service with EdgeIX (see Private Interconnects under Services). The public peering VLAN is intended for inter-network traffic exchange, not as a transport network for other purposes.

- **Routing Security:** Participants are expected to implement basic routing security measures. This includes filtering incoming routes (for example, using prefix filters or maximum prefix limits on peers, and honoring BGP community signals like NO_EXPORT or blackhole communities where used). EdgeIX’s route servers perform IRR/RPKI-based filtering, but bilateral sessions do not have the exchange’s automated filtering – so participants are responsible for safeguarding their own bilateral sessions. In case of a route leak or hijack detected, EdgeIX staff may notify the offending participant and/or other participants to drop the erroneous announcements. Repeated route leaks or advertisement of bogon/unallocated prefixes by a participant will be considered a policy violation.
- **Peering Disputes:** In the event of any dispute between participants (for example, one network believes another is not abiding by a mutual peering agreement, or is sending inappropriate traffic), EdgeIX may act as a neutral facilitator if requested. However, EdgeIX will generally not arbitrate business disputes or traffic ratio arguments – those must be resolved between networks. EdgeIX’s interest is mainly if a dispute leads to violations of these overall policies or threatens the exchange’s operations. Participants are encouraged to resolve peering issues in a collegial manner off-platform.
- **Route Server Opt-Out:** If a participant does not wish to peer with specific other networks via the route server, they can use BGP community controls to instruct the route server accordingly (as mentioned above). Alternatively, they may choose not to use the route server at all and only establish direct sessions with selected peers. Using the exchange does not force any participant to peer with everyone; it simply provides the opportunity. All participants must respect that others may have restrictive policies and are not obligated to accept a peering session. Conversely, participants with restrictive policies should handle their filtering on their side (or via route server communities) and not pressure EdgeIX to remove any particular participant from the exchange. EdgeIX is open to all qualified networks and will not bar participants just because some networks don’t wish to peer with them (except in cases of policy violation or legal issues as described elsewhere).

In summary, EdgeIX Beirut’s peering policy is to provide an open, neutral platform for networks to peer, while requiring that participants use BGP responsibly and do not misuse the exchange for transit or illegal purposes. By joining EdgeIX, participants acknowledge that they will engage in peering in good faith according to these guidelines.

## Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

All participants and their traffic flowing through EdgeIX Beirut must adhere to this Acceptable Use Policy. The AUP is designed to maintain the integrity, security, and fairness of the exchange for everyone. Violation of the AUP can result in immediate action, including suspension of the offending port or termination of the participant’s connection (see Termination section). By connecting to EdgeIX, participants agree **not** to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:

- **No Abuse of the Exchange Fabric:** Participants shall not flood the exchange with excessive broadcast, unknown-unicast, or multicast traffic beyond normal operational needs (e.g., only ARP/ND and occasional multicast for routing protocols if any are acceptable). Intentional transmission of continuous high-volume broadcast or multicast traffic, or any form of traffic flooding that could disrupt exchange operations or consume unnecessary switch capacity, is prohibited.
- **No Malicious Traffic or Attacks:** The exchange must not be used to conduct denial-of-service attacks, intrusion attempts, or any malicious cyber activities targeting other participants or external networks. Participants must ensure that their connected equipment is not launching attacks (for instance, not part of a botnet using the IX to scan or attack others). If a participant becomes aware that their network is sourcing an attack (e.g., a compromised server spewing traffic), they are expected to take immediate action to stop it. EdgeIX may proactively filter or disconnect a port if it is observed participating in an ongoing attack to protect the community. Additionally, obviously malicious traffic such as constant port scans or exploitation attempts directed at others via the IX is forbidden.
- **No Eavesdropping or Snooping:** Participants should only send and receive traffic intended for their own networks or those of their peering agreements. Interception of other participants’ traffic (e.g., via ARP spoofing, MAC flooding, or other man-in-the-middle techniques) is strictly prohibited. The exchange fabric is a shared medium, but EdgeIX implements isolation such that participants should only see traffic addressed to them. Any attempt to circumvent these protections to capture or inspect another network’s traffic is a severe violation and likely illegal.
- **No Third-Party Transit:** As noted in the Peering Policy, participants may not use the exchange to carry traffic for third parties that are not themselves connected and in mutual agreement. Each participant’s port is for exchanging traffic between that participant’s network (and its customers) and other connected networks. It is not to be resold or used as a general transit link between two other networks. For example, if Network A is connected, they cannot offer to carry traffic across the IX for Network C that is not present at EdgeIX. Similarly, a participant should not extend connectivity from the IX port to another external entity (e.g., by physically patching in another ISP or customer to their port) without authorization from EdgeIX. All traffic on the exchange should originate from or be destined to the participant’s own network and its direct customers or peers.
- **No Unauthorized Sharing or Reselling of Ports:** A participant’s port is meant for that participant’s sole use (and their internal network or customer routes as per normal BGP). Participants are not allowed to share their port with other organizations or entities that are not officially registered with EdgeIX as part of their organization. For example, two ISPs cannot split the cost of one port and each use it for their own ASN without notifying EdgeIX — each distinct network ASN connecting should have its own agreement with EdgeIX (or a formal reseller arrangement if one is acting as a reseller for remote peering, which would be explicitly authorized by EdgeIX). If a participant is found to be informally reselling or allowing an unauthorized party to piggyback on their connection, EdgeIX will consider this a breach of policy.
- **Adherence to Technical Rules:** All technical standards outlined in the previous section must be followed as part of acceptable use. This includes not sending disallowed Layer-2 protocols (no STP, CDP, etc.), using only the assigned MAC and IP addresses, and not exceeding reasonable usage of ARP/ND. Participants should also ensure no DHCP or other unauthorized services are active on the exchange interface. Violating technical requirements (even accidentally) is considered non-compliance with the AUP. EdgeIX will typically alert the participant if, for example, an STP BPDU is detected from their port, but repeated incidents can lead to port shutdown.
- **Routing Integrity:** Participants must only advertise routes which they are authorized to announce (their own prefixes or those of their downstream customers with permission). Advertisement of prefixes not owned or assigned (prefix hijacking), or a broader prefix that encompasses someone else’s more specific (to hijack traffic), is strictly forbidden. Additionally, participants should not propagate routing information learned from one peer to another (no re-advertisement of peers’ prefixes to other peers, especially via the route server – the route server is configured to prevent this by default). In essence, each BGP session on the exchange should be bilateral (or multilateral via RS) and not be used to carry transit routes between other parties. Participants found propagating routes improperly will be disconnected until the issue is fixed.
- **Collaboration and Issue Resolution:** If a participant is notified by EdgeIX or by another participant’s NOC of an issue (such as a route leak, a malfunctioning interface causing flaps, a security incident, etc.), they are expected to respond and address the issue promptly. Unresponsiveness to repeated operational issues is a violation of the cooperative spirit expected on the exchange. While this is more of a community etiquette, gross negligence in maintaining one’s connection (for example, leaving a misconfigured router online that repeatedly destabilizes the peering fabric) will be treated as a breach of acceptable use.
- **Prohibited Content and Activities:** EdgeIX does not monitor or filter the content of traffic, as it’s just a exchange medium, but if EdgeIX is officially informed by authorities that a participant’s connection is being used for illegal activities (e.g., distributing illegal content, participating in cybercrime, etc.), EdgeIX will take appropriate action as required by law. Participants should ensure that their use of the exchange does not knowingly facilitate criminal activities. Additionally, any use of the exchange that could bring EdgeIX into disrepute or legal jeopardy (such as using EdgeIX connectivity to bypass lawful intercept or censorship in an unlawful manner) is not allowed. Participants are expected to abide by Lebanese laws concerning content and connectivity.

**Traffic Monitoring and Privacy:** EdgeIX monitors aggregate traffic levels and may inspect traffic patterns or packet headers as needed for troubleshooting and ensuring compliance with these policies (for example, checking for disallowed protocols or identifying a traffic flood source). However, EdgeIX does not inspect packet payloads or snoop into the content of communications between participants. Any monitoring is done in accordance with privacy laws and purely for operational integrity. Participants should be aware that if they violate technical rules (like sending BPDUs), those frames may be captured for analysis. All participants are responsible for the privacy and security of their own traffic – end-to-end encryption of sensitive data is recommended as always on any shared network.

In summary, the Acceptable Use Policy can be boiled down to: **use the IX for its intended purpose (peering), be considerate and security-conscious, and do not do anything that harms others or the facility.** EdgeIX will enforce these rules to maintain a healthy environment for all connected networks.

## Connectivity Models and Services Offered

EdgeIX Beirut is positioned as a full-service interconnection platform, offering a range of connectivity options and services. As a carrier-neutral and data center-neutral IX, EdgeIX can facilitate connections from various locations and provide services beyond basic public peering.

### Physical Connectivity Options

- **On-Site Connection (In-Facility Cross-Connect):** Participants colocated in the main facility connect via a single-mode fiber cross-connect.
- **Remote Connection (National Transit Service):** Off-site participants may connect through the Lebanese Ministry of Telecommunications’ National Transit Service (NTS).
- **Future Site Expansion and Neutrality:** EdgeIX may expand to additional sites interconnected by high-capacity fiber while remaining neutral to all carriers.

### Service Offerings

- **Public Peering Fabric:** The shared VLAN for multilateral peering, with route servers provided for convenience.
- **Private Interconnects:** Dedicated VLANs for private peering or customer-provider relationships.
- **Cloud Connectivity Access:** Planned services to reach major cloud providers via the exchange.
- **IP Transit Facilitation:** The IX can facilitate introductions and interconnections with transit providers present on the platform.
- **Remote Peering (Reseller Partnerships):** Future partnerships may allow remote networks to access EdgeIX via authorized carriers.
- **Traffic Statistics and Portal:** Participants can view traffic graphs and manage their account via an online portal.
- **Support Services:** 24/7 assistance and optional professional services are available.

EdgeIX Beirut’s service suite is continually evolving. New offerings will be communicated to participants and remain subject to these policies.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Performance

EdgeIX targets 99.99% or higher availability of the exchange platform with redundant infrastructure and 24/7 monitoring. Scheduled maintenance is announced in advance and performed during off-peak hours. In case of service degradation under EdgeIX control, participants may receive service credits per their contracts.

## Billing and Fees

EdgeIX charges port fees based on port speed. Additional services such as private interconnects may incur extra charges. Invoices are typically issued monthly with standard payment terms. Late payment may result in suspension.

## Legal and Compliance

All services operate under Lebanese law. Participants must possess any required licenses for telecommunications activity. EdgeIX disclaims liability for indirect damages and expects participants to indemnify the exchange against claims arising from their use. Policies may change and participants will be informed accordingly.

## Security and Safety

The exchange operates in a secure data center with restricted access. EdgeIX enforces technical security measures such as MAC filtering and storm control. Participants are responsible for securing their own equipment and cooperating in the event of security incidents.

## Termination of Service

Participants may terminate service with notice according to their agreements. EdgeIX may suspend or terminate a connection for policy violations, non-payment, or legal orders. Upon termination, ports are disabled and IP addresses reclaimed.

## Conclusion

By connecting to EdgeIX Beirut, participants agree to abide by these policies and work cooperatively to maintain a stable and efficient interconnection environment for Lebanon and the region.
