description: Outlines the process for handling disputes between participants and clarifies OpenIX role as a neutral facilitator in conflict resolution.
---

In the event of any dispute between participants (for example, one network believes another is not abiding by a mutual peering agreement, or is sending inappropriate traffic), OpenIX may act as a neutral facilitator if requested. However, OpenIX will generally not arbitrate business disputes or traffic ratio arguments – those must be resolved between networks.

OpenIX’s interest is mainly if a dispute leads to violations of these overall policies or threatens the exchange’s operations. Participants are encouraged to resolve peering issues in a collegial manner off-platform.
