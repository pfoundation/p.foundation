# OpenIX

OpenIX Internet Exchange is a carrier-neutral interconnection platform that enables networks to efficiently exchange internet traffic.

The following policy outlines the terms, conditions, and standards for connecting to and using OpenIX. All participants must adhere to these policies to maintain a secure, efficient, and fair peering environment. OpenIX is committed to international best practices and adheres strictly to local laws and regulatory requirements in each country where it operates.

## Governance and Organizational Structure

OpenIX is owned and operated by the non-profit P Foundation in collaboration with its local OpenIX subsidiaries. All governance, management, and strategic decisions are handled internally by OpenIX’s professional team.

OpenIX maintains a neutral governance stance and is not affiliated with any single service provider, carrier, or data center. Neutrality is assured by offering the same terms and services to all participants without discrimination. The OpenIX team may seek input from the peering community informally, but participants do not have formal governance roles or decision-making power in the IX’s operations. All policy changes or service modifications are decided by OpenIX management, who will communicate updates to participants in a timely manner.

OpenIX operates in compliance with the local telecommunications regulations and applicable laws of each jurisdiction in which it operates. Where required, OpenIX obtains and maintains any licenses or approvals necessary for operating a commercial Internet Exchange. The organization ensures alignment with local regulatory authorities' guidelines, along with global best practices for Internet Exchanges.

As an initiative operated by the non-profit P Foundation, OpenIX structures its fees to cover operational costs plus a minimal profit margin capped at 30%. This surplus is fully reinvested into the P Foundation to support further development and sustainability of OpenIX and related projects. The primary aim is to deliver a stable, efficient, and open interconnection environment benefiting the broader internet ecosystem in each region.
