# OpenIX Beirut

OpenIX Beirut was officially announced on [May 13, 2025](/messages/IntroducingOpenIXBeirut), marking a major milestone in the effort to localize Lebanon’s internet infrastructure. As the country’s first _truly carrier-neutral_ Internet Exchange Point, OpenIX Beirut was created in direct response to the failure of previous IXs in Lebanon. It enforces a strict connectivity policy and a transparent, open model to ensure all ISPs and networks can connect efficiently and equitably. This neutral hub allows local data to stay local, drastically improving speed, resilience, and cost-effectiveness.

By bringing together ISPs, content providers, and infrastructure partners, OpenIX Beirut supports the growth of locally hosted content and services. Today, only 36% of Lebanon’s internet traffic is served domestically. Our goal is to raise that number to **56% by the end of 2025**, reaching the Asia regional average. Local peering means faster access to websites, smoother streaming, lower costs for service providers, and better internet experiences for everyone.

OpenIX Beirut is not just about better technology—it’s about building a more resilient and inclusive digital ecosystem for Lebanon. It gives networks of all sizes the ability to grow, interconnect, and serve users efficiently within the country.
