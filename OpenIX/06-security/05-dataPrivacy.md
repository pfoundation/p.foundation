title: Data Privacy
description: OpenIX's data privacy practices regarding participant information, usage data, and the expected confidentiality among exchange members.
---

Although not “security” in the network sense, data privacy is important.
OpenIX might collect some data about participants (business contact info, technical contact info, possibly traffic volume statistics per ASN for aggregate reports, etc.).

We treat this data as private and use it only for operational purposes or as required by law. We do not sell participant data to marketers or such.

Any personal data (like names, phone numbers of contacts) is stored securely and only accessible to authorized OpenIX staff. Participants similarly should respect privacy of others; for instance, one participant should not attempt to enumerate or publicize another’s traffic stats if they somehow learned them.
