The OpenIX switching hardware and related equipment are housed in a professional data center with robust physical security controls. Access to the data center is restricted to authorized personnel only, with measures such as badge access, biometric scanners, surveillance cameras, and on-site security staff.

OpenIX equipment is typically installed in locked racks or cages within the facility; only OpenIX operations staff (or authorized remote hands personnel under OpenIX supervision) are permitted to directly access this hardware. Participants **do not** have physical access to the exchange’s switches or route server systems.

If participants have their own equipment co-located in the same facility (e.g., a router in a nearby rack), they must follow the data center’s security protocols for accessing their gear – such as escort policies, access lists, and visitation hours.

Any physical maintenance on OpenIX infrastructure is logged and often requires dual-person authorization, reducing risk of tampering. These practices are aligned with international data center security standards (ISO 27001 and SOC 2 principles for physical security).
