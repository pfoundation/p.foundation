title: Infrastructure Resiliency
description: Data center environmental controls, backup systems, fire suppression, and emergency procedures that ensure infrastructure reliability.
---

From a safety standpoint, the data center provides environmental controls (cooling, fire suppression, etc.) to protect equipment. Power is backed up by UPS and generators to ensure continuous operation.

OpenIX regularly tests backup systems (for example, simulating power failure scenarios) to verify everything functions as expected.

Fire suppression systems (inert gas or pre-action sprinklers) are in place to protect against fire without damaging equipment.

In case of any building emergency (fire, flooding, etc.), there are procedures to safely shut down equipment if needed and to restore it when safe.

Participants will be notified if any such emergency impacts the exchange.
