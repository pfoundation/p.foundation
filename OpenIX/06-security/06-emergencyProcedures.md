description: OpenIX's incident response plan for security events, communication protocols during emergencies, and recommendations for participants.
---

In case of a major security incident (for example, a widespread virus affecting many participants or a targeted attack on the IX infrastructure), OpenIX will act swiftly, possibly invoking an emergency shutdown of parts of the network if needed to isolate the issue.

We will communicate via all available channels (e.g., email, phone, messaging groups) to alert participants.

OpenIX maintains an **incident response plan** for various scenarios (including cybersecurity incidents, physical disasters, etc.), and this plan is periodically reviewed and tested. Participants should ensure their NOC contacts are current so they can be reached during such events.

Itâ€™s also recommended for participants to subscribe to OpenIX provides emergency notification system and follow our social media channels.
